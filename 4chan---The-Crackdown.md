### Rumors of conspiracy

During the GamerGate shitstorm, some anons began to notice that their threads were being deleted. At best, the mods were trying to contain them in one thread. At worst, the mods were in cahoots with Zoe Quinn herself.

### Moot's Public Statement

On September 18th, 2014, Moot made this sticky on /v/:

> The decision to remove "GamerGate" threads has been poorly communicated, and that's my fault. Said threads are being deleted primarily because they violate our blanket "no personal information / raids / calls to invasion" rule. Spamming the reports system and creating multiple topics were also a factor, especially given /v/ is one of 4chan's fastest moving boards and has historically struggled with keeping topics limited to actual video games.  
> Regarding a perceived lack of free speech/censorship -- many seem to misinterpret my advocating for anonymous communication and highlighting that it allows people to share things they otherwise wouldn't be comfortable with on other platforms as "you can say and do anything on 4chan," which simply isn't the case. We've had rules and moderators since the site was founded *11 years ago*, and I've only reinforced this statement over the years, a la: https://archive.moe/q/thread/580080/#580135  
> To those who actually want to use /v/ to discuss vidya and not a movement that has outgrown 4chan (a la Project Chanology) -- apologies for the inconvenience.
