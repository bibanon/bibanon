*Train Man* and the Gender Politics of Japanese '*Otaku*' Culture: The
Rise of New Media, Nerd Heroes and Consumer Communities \
\

1.  *Train Man (Densha otoko)* has been one of the most significant
    recent Japanese popular culture phenomena and represents the
    interrelationship between the development of new media, marketing
    trends and notions of masculinity.[[1]](#n1) A sentimental love
    story of an awkward nerd and a fashionable workingwoman based on
    supposedly real events, *Train Man* was collectively written through
    anonymous posts on the influential 2-Channel Internet forum from
    March to May 2004 and centres on the couple and the online community
    who encouraged them. Train Man and most of his supporters are
    '*otaku*,' generally negative slang for an avid fan who brings 'a
    passionate, single-minded intensity to bear on his object of
    obsession.'[[2]](#n2) In *Train Man*, *otaku* are portrayed as
    spending time and money on obtaining knowledge about and owning
    things that provide the potential for participation in global
    networks that run parallel to but often do not oppose local groups
    of family, school and work, which have formed the backbone of
    Japanese society. This tale of life-altering love has been sold as
    an Internet book (professionally-published paper edition of a story
    created and first made available online), a film, a serialised
    television drama, four manga series, a stage play and even an adult
    video. Because of the commercial appeal of Train Man's successful
    romantic relationship, corporate interests and the mass media have
    promoted the protagonist as representing a new sexualised identity
    and a harbinger of consumer fads, while continuing to describe the
    existence of *otaku* fan cultures as a symptom of Japanese
    socioeconomic problems. \
     \
2.  I argue that, along with changing the form of the book and
    furthering cross-media promotion, the protagonist of *Train Man* has
    encouraged more discussions about social expectations for Japanese
    men in the mass media during a time of falling marriage and
    birthrates than any other real personage or fictional character.
    Media discourses about *Train Man* reached a height in 2005 and 2006
    when global fandoms of Japanese *otaku* culture grew and fertility
    rates were declared a national problem. In news magazines devoted to
    issues of marriage and family and the concurrent spate of books
    about heterosexual relationships, Train Man has been described as a
    potential marriage partner for career women, a demographic blamed
    for marrying late. At the same time, he has been promoted as an
    ideal consumer, loyal to brands and willing to spend money on
    self-improvement. \
     \
3.  As discussed below, although exposing contradictions inherent in
    gender norms promoted by state institutions and broadening
    conceptions of masculinity in the popular imagination, most
    journalistic accounts and marketing campaigns centring on Train Man
    recast patriarchal notions of love and family for the
    twenty-first-century Internet generation. In mass media discussions
    about Train Man, exemplified by those in weekly news magazines
    targeting a middle-class educated readership, the kind of *otaku*
    culture represented by the protagonist has been mobilised to
    advocate the conservative notion that individual happiness is most
    easily achieved by conforming to so-called mainstream society.
    Reflexively, *otaku* such as Train Man have been ascribed with the
    potential to change the society to which they once conformed. In
    striking contrast, female *otaku* have often been seen in a
    different light. Crimes against both male and female *otaku*,
    especially in Tokyo's Akihabara district, are extreme examples
    revealing that Train Man and his fan community might not be ideals
    accepted by the entire Japanese population. Members of
    *otaku*communities have also voiced dissent. \
     \
4.  In this paper, I first explore how this male character has shaped
    Japanese media and publishing trends, furthering the success of
    cell-phone novels (*keitai shōsetsu*) and other new book forms. I
    then raise questions about the social, economic and ideological
    impact of the image of masculinity that the story conveys and how it
    has shaped recent discussions about women, motherhood and labour, in
    addition to men and marriage. To provide a more composite and
    perhaps less mediated examination of Train Man, I have researched
    untraditional academic sources, including Internet forums, websites,
    advertising campaigns and blogs, along with widely circulating books
    and magazines issued by commercial presses. By analysing a limited
    sample of the almost countless online fan sites devoted to *otaku*
    culture, I attempt to understand the mixed reactions of members of
    the community Train Man is said to symbolise to the incorporation of
    the story into dominant heteronormative state discourses.[[3]](#n3)
    \
    \
    \
     **How Fans Created Train Man and Engendered Media Trends** \
     \
5.  *Train Man*was made possible by and exemplifies the cultural
    influence of the expansive 2-Channel Internet forum. Founded in 1999
    by the then twenty-three-year-old Nishimura Hiroyuki, 2-Channel
    receives more than 500 million page views a month.[[4]](#n4) All
    2-Channel users remain anonymous or are addressed by nicknames,
    enabling them to chat about subjects that might be taboo in
    face-to-face conversations. To keep topics current and save
    bandwidth, threads are limited to 1,000 posts, and users have the
    power to continue discussions by adding threads. Posts on the BBS
    (Internet Bulletin Board System) cannot be deleted. Along with text
    messages, 2-channel subscribers post ASCII artwork, often elaborate
    pictures made out of letters, punctuation marks and other printable
    characters. \
     \
6.  The story began after a shy twenty-two year old, given the handle
    'Train Man' on the second day of the discussion, protected a woman
    from a drunk on a Tokyo train.[[5]](#n5) Although such harassment is
    common on Tokyo trains, help from a stranger is not, and the woman
    sent Train Man expensive Hermes brand teacups to show her gratitude.
    While the choice of Hermes cups is unusual, gift giving is an
    accepted way of showing appreciation in Japan. In a post that was
    part of a larger forum on computer games on a board for '*doku
    otoko*,' the title of which is a pun for men who are both 'single'
    (*doku*) and regard themselves to be as unattractive as 'poison'
    (also pronounced '*doku'*), Train Man, who had never had a
    girlfriend, asked for advice on how to invite the woman,
    affectionately nicknamed 'Hermes,' on a date. \
     \
7.  From the start, Train Man appeared as an exceptionally sensitive and
    caring person, with whom many 2-Channel subscribers felt a sense of
    empathy and a desire to help. The story developed as the online
    community, mostly men, offered and debated suggestions on how Train
    Man could make Hermes fall in love with him and as Train Man
    reported the events of his new relationship and feelings about how
    his life was changing. The story increasingly attracted new writers
    and readers and spread far outside the 'poison man' board. \
     \
8.  In 2004, the fifty-seven-day online conversation that included a
    total of 29,862 posts was edited into a six-chapter story of 1,919
    posts and made available on a free website.[[6]](#n6) Fans rendered
    the website into other world languages, such as the 2006 English
    translation by 'Project.Densha.' *Train Man*reached a global
    audience and was particularly popular in other parts of Asia and
    with Japanese communities in Europe and the United States.[[7]](#n7)
    Each chapter of the online novel detailed a separate 'mission' that
    Train Man needed to complete in order to further his romance and
    included such tasks as inviting Hermes to dinner and holding her
    hand. The resulting narrative of boy meets girl and boy tries to
    take control of the relationship focused as much on Train Man as the
    fan community who supported him. \
     \
9.  Train Man and his supporters are self-identified '*otaku*,' a
    derogatory term coined in studies of antisocial behaviours in the
    first half of the 1980s and made notorious by serial killer Miyazaki
    Tsutomu in 1989.[[8]](#n8) Especially from the early 1990s,
    *otaku*became a form of address among like-minded fans, as evident
    in the 1991 cult-hit mockumentary *Otaku no bideo* (Otaku Video).
    Although applied to other fandoms, the term is now mostly used both
    playfully and pejoratively to denote ardent collectors of manga,
    anime and computer technologies. Because of the global popularity of
    these forms of popular culture, *otaku*has had more positive
    connotations abroad than in Japan. *Otaku* implies the constant
    desire to learn more about a hobby, either for profit or for
    pleasure, and the sense of pride in being able to trade in knowledge
    of things that are often cutting-edge. Some of the world's richest
    and most influential men have been technology *otaku*, including
    Microsoft's Bill Gates and 2-Channel's administrator Nishimura
    Hiroyuki, showing the power and profitability of this form of geek
    culture. \
     \
10. Especially in discussions among fans, *otaku* are divided into
    subgroups. Train Man represents the 'Akiba-kei *otaku*' or the
    predominantly male denizens of Tokyo's Akihabara electronics
    district, a subculture that is not too far removed from mainstream
    urban society. In *Train Man*, Akiba-kei *otaku*are portrayed as
    manifesting both conspicuous consumption and production, giving rise
    to new trends, vocabularies and behaviours through the shared desire
    for brands and commodities. Members of Akiba-kei Internet forums,
    interviewees in media reports and bloggers have generally expressed
    a mix of shame and pride in belonging to these communities— feelings
    articulated by Train Man. \
     \
11. Through the online conversation that often reads as a guide to
    fashion and dating in Tokyo, Train Man gained confidence, especially
    as he changed his clothing and hairstyle. Train Man hid but did not
    give up his *otaku* identity. In a pivotal point in their
    relationship, he used his knowledge of computers to impress Hermes,
    whose nickname also shows an association with consumer culture. \
     \
12. On 9 May 2004, Train Man posted on 2-Channel that he had confessed
    his love for Hermes, and, according to the edited story, the online
    community celebrated. Love confessions are a stock part of Japanese
    fiction and film, but Train Man unconventionally discussed his fears
    and feelings with other characters, rather than just making the
    reader privy to these private thoughts. In the last posts included
    in the story, the 2-Channel subscribers tell Train Man that he had
    successfully graduated from his lessons on how to be an ideal
    romantic partner and no longer needed the advice of the *otaku*
    community, who have, in turn, learned from his example. His task was
    to now advance into 'mainstream' society, remembering the people who
    helped him motivate and mobilise to change but leaving his former
    life behind. The participants in the online discussion gave Train
    Man a send-off and bade him well, implying that, although a hero, he
    was no longer one of them. According to *Train Man* websites and
    blogs, it is rumoured that the couple is still together, although
    their real identities remain unknown. \
     \
13. Notably, notions of mobility are integral to Train Man's identity
    formation, for he had to leave one community to enter another.
    Ironically, Train Man's transformation was encouraged by many
    2-Channel subscribers who manifest their withdrawal from society
    through spatial retreat, feeling more comfortable interacting with
    people online rather than face-to-face. In some versions of the
    story, a few of Train Man's supporters were *hikikomori*,
    predominantly young men who enclose themselves in their homes and
    refuse to participate in the world outside. While perpetuating
    stereotypes of women in general and of subcultures of men, Train Man
    has influenced the development of a new kind of romantic male hero
    in Japanese literature and visual media: the compassionate,
    motivated *otaku* with disposable income and leisure time. Train Man
    marks a departure from common images of the stoic middle-class
    businessman, a figure who represented twentieth-century Japanese
    social ideals. Yet to be this *otaku* hero, Train Man needed to move
    outside his community and prove that wanted to and could conform to
    notions of male behaviour that have dominated the popular
    imagination since the post-war period. Thus, the construction of
    Train Man's identity is fraught with contradictions. \
     \
14. As news of Train Man and his supporters spread, Japanese publishing
    companies vied to turn the popular website into a book. On 4 June
    2004, Nishimura awarded the publication rights to
    thirty-four-year-old Shinchō publishing company editor Gunji Yoko,
    who had produced five successful books since 1998 but remained a
    contract rather than a lifetime employee. Because of the current
    Japanese publishing focus on so-called popular rather than more
    highbrow literature and in part due to financial losses, especially
    in sales of monthly periodicals, it has become an industry norm to
    contract young editors who are familiar with book trends. As
    exemplified by Gunji, this change has made it possible for women to
    work in higher-level positions, but, without much security, they
    often need to demonstrate that their jobs are necessary. Gunji was
    able to acquire the project from Nishimura because she proposed
    designing the book to resemble an online chat, complete with the
    ASCII artwork that appeared in the 2-Channel discussion, rather than
    developing the story into a more conventional novel with elaborate
    plot lines, character descriptions and eloquent use of
    language.[[9]](#n9) For her efforts, Gunji was awarded the honour of
    the 2006 Nikkei Woman of the Year award in the category of hit
    maker. Additionally, published at a time of proliferation of
    2-Channel user guides and the popularisation of ASCII art, as
    evident in such online fads as the Flash-animated 'Kikkoman Fight
    Song,' Train Man heightened the domination of Nishimura's Internet
    empire.[[10]](#n10) \
     \
15. Although the story website is still available for free and the URL
    address is even listed in the back of the book, more than 260,000
    copies of *Train Man* sold in the first three weeks after it was
    released on 22 October, and sales reached 1.5 million in the spring
    and summer of 2005, when the film and television series
    aired.[[11]](#n11) According to a survey published in the 22
    November 2004 issue of the news magazine *AERA*, which has focused
    in recent years on marriage and family issues, 70 per cent of the
    customers who purchased *Train Man* during the first three weeks
    were men and most likely 2-Channel participants, but, after November
    2004, 46 per cent of book buyers were female, a change that was in
    part due to advertising campaigns and the ways that news of the
    story spread through television and other media.[[12]](#n12) In
    general, most readers were older than that of other novels written
    in text-message formats, such as the teenaged American Internet
    Girls series by Laura Myracle.[[13]](#n13) \
     \
16. Produced at a time when publishing companies were seeking to revive
    sales, *Train Man* epitomised a new form of the book and transformed
    the act of reading. The collective author is listed as Nakano
    Hitori, a common 2-Channel phrase meaning 'one among
    us.'[[14]](#n14) No editor's name is provided. Because the posts are
    anonymous and the real Train Man and Hermes are unknown, notions of
    copyright, royalties and press releases changed. If Train Man were
    real, he should receive part of the copyright, which now belongs to
    Nishimura.[[15]](#n15) The 364-page book is arranged into six
    missions, all entirely composed of online posts; those by Train Man
    shaded in gray. A closing discussion on 16 May, a week after Train
    Man's confession of love, serves as an epilogue.[[16]](#n16) Very
    little explanation is given, implying that the target reader is
    familiar with the story and format. The story is told almost
    entirely through dialogue and makes the reader feel as though she is
    overhearing a conversation among a crowd. This new narrative form
    allows the plot to unfold in real time. \
     \
17. The book is full of [languages created by Japanese Internet
    users](http://services.4-ch.net/2chportal/), resulting in a
    different appearance on the page and demanding familiarity with
    2-Channel to be fully appreciated.[[17]](#n17) Often focused on the
    visuality of words and puns, aspects of this language include using
    homophones for Chinese characters, a technique that is not new and
    was used for transliteration of Western words into Japanese in the
    nineteenth century. This is evident in the author's name Nakano
    Hitori. In addition, long vowel sounds are shortened, short ones are
    lengthened, similar but incorrect characters are used, and two-word
    phrases are abbreviated into two syllables, a common way of
    referring to contemporary buzzwords and brands. For example, the
    popular coffee shop Starbucks is called 'Staba.' \
     \
18. *Train Man* furthered the intersection between Japanese literature
    and new media, demonstrating a transformation in ways that Internet
    technology was affecting cultural production. Internet novels in a
    different format were published before *Train Man* but were not
    commercially successful. For example, in 2000, film director Iwai
    Shunji posted an interactive online website as part of plans for a
    film about the relationship between a Hong Kong pop star and a
    Taiwanese teen. Japanese adolescents logged on to talk about
    problems, including school bullying, in addition to respond to the
    story about music. Iwai published the posts in the book *Riri shu
    shu no subete* (All About Lily Chou Cho) in August 2001 and released
    poignant but horrifying film by the same title about three months
    later by the same distributor, Rockwell Eyes.[[18]](#n18) Unlike
    this and other earlier Internet novels, *Train Man* and the books it
    has inspired lightheartedly impart positive messages and begin with
    chance encounters. \
     \
19. Additionally, the success of the *Train Man* Internet novel was
    perhaps instrumental in advancing publishing company experimentation
    with other new book forms written by amateur authors and enabled by
    new media. A prime example is the genre of 'cell-phone novels' that
    developed when telecommunications providers began offering unlimited
    text messaging in their monthly plans and flourished especially
    between 2006 and 2007. Most of Japan's bestsellers in these years
    were cell-phone novels. Readers, predominantly young women,
    subscribe to mostly free websites to receive installments of these
    dialogue-driven, single-authored stories on their cell phones. They
    can then read this mobile form of popular literature on trains and
    in other public spaces, thereby changing the nature of telling,
    circulating and consuming stories. Notably, like *Train Man*,
    cell-phone novels, which can be obtained for free, are published as
    books that sell hundreds of thousands, even millions, of copies and
    are made into television dramas, films and manga. For example, *Ayu
    no monogatari* (Deep Love), by an author known only as Yoshi, had
    grossed around 4.8 million yen by 2005 and the supposedly
    nonfictional *Koizora* (Love Sky), by Mika, ranked third on the
    national bestseller list in 2006 and earned 12.4 million
    yen.[[19]](#n19) The format and layout of cell-phone novels are more
    conventional than that of *Train Man*. \
     \
20. Although a few disparaging posts and obscene examples of ASCII art
    appeared on 2-Channel, they were not included in the *Train Man*
    website and book.[[20]](#n20) According to the calculations by
    journalist Andō Kenji, only 6.4 per cent of the entire 2-Channel
    online conversation was included in the edited website and book, and
    there were at least four different endings that were less optimistic
    than the one that ended the published narrative and thereby
    prevented additional interpretations of the story.[[21]](#n21)
    Instead, the Internet community appears unified in their sincere
    desire to help 'one of us.' A note on the last page, presumably by
    Nakano Hitori, praises Train Man's courage and the 2-Channel users'
    sense of community. Beneath is an ASCII-art picture of two Monā
    cats, the 2-Channel mascot along with Giko neko, another ASCII-art
    cat figure, representing Train Man and Hermes. Hermes remarks that
    2-Channel supporters are all good people, as they walk out an exit
    door, showing her approval of the kinds of *otaku* portrayed and the
    role that mobility played in their story.[[22]](#n22) \
     \
21. Accordingly, *Train Man* can be read as a prime example of the 'pure
    love' (*jun'ai*) stories that were proliferating at the time and
    marketed toward both men and women. Pure-love stories have emerged
    as a distinct genre with its own defining conventions and tropes. In
    most cases, one or more of the characters falls in love for the
    first time, and the couple needs to overcome obstacles to be
    together. The stories end or a character dies before the love can
    become soiled with more mundane aspects of domestic
    life.[[23]](#n23) To date, the most popular pure-love story has been
    Katayama Kyoichi's 2001 *Sekai no chūshin de, ai o sakebu* (Crying
    Out Love, In the Center of the World), nicknamed 'Seka-chū.'
    Published in 2001, Seka-chū became the bestselling Japanese book of
    the twenty-first century in 2004 in part because of the efforts by a
    Shogakukan publishing company salesman to mobilise the book's fan
    base and the promotion by such young actresses as Shibasaki Kō, who
    appeared in the movie version. As evident in such cell-phone novels
    as *Deep Love*, many recent pure-love stories have increasingly
    focused on underdog characters who seek lost innocence and salvation
    through heterosexual romance, such as teenaged prostitutes who had
    to sell their bodies for reasons beyond their control. \
     \
22. In addition to representing changes in the content and form of
    contemporary Japanese literature, *Train Man* exemplified the new
    ways stories were marketed. Namely, the phenomenon furthered the
    emphasis on cross-media promotion that was especially shown to be
    successful with Seka-chū, which was made into a manga, film and
    serialised television drama in 2004 and a Korean movie in 2005. Four
    manga versions of *Train Man*, using conventions of both *seinen*and
    *shōjo* genres (graphic novels targeting boys and girls,
    respectively) were published in 2005; one series was translated
    almost immediately into English and French. A play was staged in
    September 2005 on a multimedia set comprised of small interlocking
    rooms, conveying a sense of the 2-Channel individuals who supported
    Train Man.[[24]](#n24) Adaptations were timed to maintain the
    popularity of the trend. In addition, companion volumes,
    sociological studies and self-help books were published in the same
    year, marking one of the first times in recent years that popular
    fiction inspired examination of Japanese social structures and
    individual psychology. Prime examples are *Otōsan ni mo wakaru*? –
    jun'ai manuaru tettei kaiseki (The Story of Train Man – A Complete
    Guide to Pure Love that Even Your Father Can Understand) by the
    'Train Man Friendship Society' and *Arigato! Densha otoko – 50 man
    nin ga namidashita junai* (Thank You, Train Man!: The Pure Love
    Story that Made 500,000 People Cry).[[25]](#n25) \

23. The most successful adaptations of *Train Man*were the June 2005
    blockbuster film, shot in twenty-five days under the supervision of
    television director Murakami Masanori and released around a month
    later to mixed critical reviews, and the television series, which
    aired Thursdays at 10:00 p.m. from 7 July to 22 September 2005 on
    the Fuji Television Channel, with special episodes on 6 October 2005
    and 23 September 2006. While the book is told entirely from the
    point of view of Train Man and his supporters, the film and
    television drama show aspects of Hermes' life and portray her as
    taking most of the initiative in the budding romance. These changes
    might have been due to conventions of film and television melodramas
    or were added to make Train Man a more empathetic character with
    perhaps a greater appeal to the target consumer demographic of
    eighteen to thirty-four-year-old female viewers. The film and drama
    had different casts, but the actor who played Train Man in the film
    made a cameo appearance in the drama and vice versa. The *Train Man*
    movie relied on the actor's star power, but the male lead Yamada
    Takayuki (who starred in the Seka-chū television drama) was said to
    be too handsome.[[26]](#n26) \
     \
24. In May 2005, Fuji Television representatives handed out fliers in
    Akihabara, requesting 'real' *otaku* to act as extras in the
    television drama, which was more successful than the film in terms
    of character development and parodied the people it
    celebrated.[[27]](#n27) The last episode of this extremely popular
    series was viewed by more than 25.5 per cent of the national
    television audience.[[28]](#n28) The theme song sequence, a scene
    from an anime series created for the *Train Man* drama, was made to
    seem like an existing twenty-six-episode program, complete with
    female voice actresses and merchandise. It was produced as a real
    series, *Getsumento heiki mina*, loosely translated as Moon-Faced
    Rabbit Weapon Mina, that aired from January to March 2007 on Fuji
    Television, the same network as the drama. The television series
    ended in a very 'adult' kiss, the kind that is rarely shown in
    primetime, which was significantly, initiated by Hermes. Although an
    adult video, *The Kissing and Sex of Train Man* was created, there
    has been no animated version of the tale to date. \
     \
25. The film and the television series clearly visualised the class
    message inherent in the story. For example, the man who harassed
    Hermes on the train appeared to be working class, and Hermes and
    Train Man often carried things with recognisable cultural capital,
    especially designer goods and bags from Akihabara shops. Both visual
    forms depicted different kinds of 2-Channel users, and Internet
    posts influenced the content and visual compositions. In addition to
    various *otaku*, the film and television drama showed hurt and
    lonely people, including battered women, alienated married couples
    and hopeless youth, all of whom learned from Train Man's courage.
    *Otaku* characters were also used to make audiences aware of
    pressing national issues, such as domestic violence and
    *hikikomori*. Through happy endings and through stunning visual
    finales, they conveyed the message that people could improve their
    lives if they tried hard enough. \
     \
26. By showing in great detail the efforts made by Train Man and his
    community and their joy in achieving their goal of a happy romantic
    relationship, the media employed the commercially successful
    Japanese formula of what I call '*gambaru*' or 'try your best and
    you will succeed' films. In *gambaru* narratives, the fallen hero
    finds confidence by excelling at an unusual hobby or an unlikely
    feat with the help of a coach and other players. The coach and other
    players, in turn, learn to love the activity through observing the
    player's hard work and thereby find hope in other aspects of their
    own lives. Different from such American 'zero-to-hero' movies as
    *Karate Kid* and *Rocky*, in Japanese *gambaru* films, the
    individual learns to be a better member of a group or family, school
    or workplace. Famous examples include the films *Shall We Dance?*,
    the tale of a salaryman who finds meaning in middle-class life
    through the subculture of ballroom dance and *Waterboys*, based on
    the true story of a high-school boys' synchronised swimming team. \

27. In 2005, different publishers created spin-off Internet books in the
    same format that were also supposedly based on true stories of
    *otaku* asking for love advice and sharing their relationships on
    2-Channel. This further attests to the profitability of the Train
    Man phenomenon and the long-accepted Japanese cultural notion that
    good ideas should be emulated. For example, *Chikan otoko* (Pervert
    Man) began with a post by a nerd obsessed with anime and reptiles
    who was mistaken for a molester. The collective author's name is
    given as Itano Sumito, literally 'those who live online,' and it was
    made into a film and manga.[[29]](#n29) The Japanese title of the
    American film *Napoleon Dynamite* is *Basu otoko* (Bus Man), which
    was released on DVD in November 2005 and sometimes marketed in
    displays near those for *Train Man*. \
    \
    \
     **The Gender Politics of Mainstream *Otaku* Culture** \
     \
28. *Train Man* fuelled the fascination among mainstream domestic
    audiences for social minority group of *otaku*, who had already
    become part of Japan's global image of 'gross national cool,' to
    borrow a phrase from journalist Douglas McGray, and a new form of
    superpower through the export of popular culture.[[30]](#n30) This
    growing interest was exemplified by the feature exhibit at the Ninth
    Biennial International Architecture Exhibition Japanese Pavilion in
    2004 on the ways that *otaku* consumer culture and communal networks
    have transformed city space and urban design.[[31]](#n31) Japanese
    guidebooks to Akihabara proliferated in 2005 and 2006 but reflected
    the view of *otaku* as an urban curiosity. New large-scale buildings
    and shops have opened in the neighbourhood, including the Akihabara
    Crossfield complex comprised of two skyscrapers. A train line
    linking Tsukuba University to Akihabara opened in 2005.[[32]](#n32)
    Additionally, the *Train Man* phenomenon occurred at a time when
    nerd culture, especially that of computer geeks, was becoming
    popular worldwide, as evident in such American television programs
    such as *Heroes* starring the Japanese character Hiro Nakamura, who
    sometimes speaks in Japanese. The word ' The *otaku*' was included
    in the *Oxford English Dictionary* (OED) in 2007. \
     \
29. On the other hand, the Japanese mass media has espoused the belief
    that *otaku* are a cause and symptom of the possible breakdown of
    Japanese society and have associated *otaku* with sexual perversion
    and the growing gap between the rich and poor during a time of
    economic restructuring. This makes the promotion of Train Man all
    the more striking. Prejudices against *otaku* have even resulted in
    hate crimes. For example, especially between 2005 and 2007, at the
    peak of the discussion on *Train Man*, the media reported several
    '*otaku* hunts'—muggings and beatings of male *otaku* and a few
    cases of the rape of women working as maids in Akihabara cafés. The
    attacks, perpetrated mostly by delinquent youth, were parodied in
    the 2006 televised version of prizewinning author Ishida Ira's
    science-fiction novel *Akihabara@DEEP*, the story of a group of
    superhero *otaku* who protect Akihabara, which also became a manga
    and movie. This late-night serialised drama starred members of the
    beautiful boy band Johnny's Jr. and famous young comedians dressed
    like stereotypes of *otaku*. \
     \
30. Misunderstandings and biases against *otaku* were also apparent in
    the media discussions about Katō Tomohiro, the twenty-five year old
    who murdered three random people by running them over with a truck
    on the pedestrian streets of Akihabara and then fatally stabbed four
    others with a knife, on Sunday, 8 June 2008—the seventh anniversary
    of the Osaka Ikeda Elementary School killings. According to global
    reports, one reason why Katō committed this 'Akihabara Massacre' was
    because he was an *otaku*, citing as proof the fact that he posted
    thousands warnings about his crime on a cell-phone Internet site,
    spent most of his time shut in his home connecting with people
    online rather than in person, drew pictures in manga style when he
    was a high-school student and possessed several anime
    DVDs.[[33]](#n33) News articles also noted Katō's 'passion for
    Akihabara,' without providing answers to why he would choose to
    attack a place he considered a sanctuary.[[34]](#n34) However, in
    his posts, Katō bemoaned the facts that he was an underemployed
    temporary worker (*haken*) at a factory in Shizoka Prefecture, who
    thought that he had lost his job the day before committing mass
    murder, and did not have a girlfriend, rather than discussing an
    *otaku* identity. The mainstream mass media noted other factors that
    could have led to Katō's horrendous crimes, including his
    frustrations with the Japanese educational examination system and
    his inability to become a lifetime company employee. Yet perhaps in
    response to public fears concerning Katō's crimes, as some critics
    charge, the Japanese government decided to finally execute Miyazaki
    Tsutomu, the original '*otaku* murderer' on 17 June 2008, ten days
    later.[[35]](#n35) \
     \
31. The popularity of *Train Man* is in part due to its claims of
    realism and promotion as a 'true love story for the Internet
    generation, to paraphrase the tagline from the American
    translation.[[36]](#n36) The truth claim has, on one hand, made
    *Train Man* a topic of media debates about national issues facing
    Japan and has made changes in the publishing industry more striking.
    Conversely, it has spurred debate among people who consider
    themselves members of the *otaku* community about whether Train Man
    is a positive role model. Conspiracy theories that *Train Man* was
    not true and was instead created by Fuji Television and Dentsu
    Advertising Company, in collusion with 2-Channel's Nishimura and
    perhaps the Japanese Government, have also circulated in books and
    online, and critics have meticulously catalogued the aspects of the
    story that did not seem possible. For example, if Train Man is
    twenty-two years old, why does he post on 2-Channel that he has been
    working for three years at a job that requires a university degree?
    Why would a youth like Train Man use the verb 'dial' in reference to
    a cell phone? The expensive brand teacups, which Train Man seems to
    have received too quickly, are a strange thank-you present for a
    young man. The time of the couple's first date is a bit mysterious,
    for Train Man and Hermes went to two restaurants in two hours, the
    first being a Japanese restaurant that conventionally serves meals
    slowly. Lastly, the website in which all of the posts were compiled
    was created too quickly.[[37]](#n37) \
     \
32. Through a confluence of marketing forces and media discourses, the
    height of the Train Man phenomenon came in 2005, the year that
    former Prime Minister Koizumi declared Japan's low fertility rates
    to be a national problem. Having steadily declined after falling
    below 2.0 in 1975, birth rates reached a then all-time low of
    1.25.[[38]](#n38) Because marriage has been viewed in government and
    journalistic discourses as a means to paternity, late marriage also
    became issue of national concern. In 2005, the average marriage age
    for men was 29.8 and twenty-eight for women.[[39]](#n39) Although
    fertility rose slightly by 23,000 babies in 2006, the Ministry of
    Health predicts that the Japanese population will drop by 30 per
    cent over the next fifty years, and 40.5 per cent of the nation will
    be older than sixty-five in 2055.[[40]](#n40) A birth rate of 2.8 is
    needed to stabilise the Japanese population.[[41]](#n41) The
    Japanese government has taken measures to raise the number of
    babies, including instituting child-care facilities, tax incentives
    and family leave laws and has shown awareness that the falling birth
    rates are related to changes in gender roles and that both men and
    women need to be better able to combine responsibilities of family
    and work outside the home.[[42]](#n42) \
     \
33. Instead of merely blaming women for selfishly choosing careers over
    marriage and family, *AERA* and other news magazines have published
    lengthy discussions about why men, especially those with so-called
    'high specs' of advanced education, elite jobs and good looks, are
    choosing to marry late or not at all and about the need to change
    the salaryman system so that fathers can play a larger role in the
    family. The main reasons given for men who do not marry are based on
    emotions, implying that they could marry but choose not
    to.[[43]](#n43) Popular culture has played a role in providing
    images that mainly support these dominant discourses, and the
    character Train Man became a means to promote marriage, and thereby
    parenthood. To the best of my knowledge, Train Man has only been
    featured in mainstream journalistic debates about heterosexual men.
    \
     \
34. Train Man shows that an *otaku* has the potential to become a new
    kind of ideal man, so long as he could acquire the looks and
    communication skills that would make him desirable to women and help
    him conform to mainstream society. Train Man did not relinquish his
    *otaku* identity and spent as much time on 2-Channel discussing his
    hobbies as he did Hermes, but he gained confidence and charm by
    changing his physical appearance. Expressed in the terms used in
    blogs and mass media articles in jest, while implying public fears
    of subcultures behind the humour, Train Man went from being an
    Aikiba-kei *otaku* to '*mote otoko*' or 'popular guy,' a man with
    the style, confidence and money to conduct himself well in romantic
    relationships.[[44]](#n44) Fashion plays a large part in the story
    and was the prime factor that distinguishes Train Man from the men
    that Hermes would ordinarily choose. \
     \
35. Notably, global narratives of socially-inept yet intelligent men
    pursuing capable, stylish women seem to share similar plot
    conventions and, although teaching that beauty is more than 'skin
    deep,' do not challenge gender norms. A common feature of most 'geek
    gets the girl' narratives is the geek's transformation scene. This
    climatic moment when the geek successfully appears to accept
    mainstream norms of masculinity convinces the girl of his inner
    beauty, thereby reaffirming stereotypes of both men and women and
    advancing consumer culture. In most cases, after the male underdog,
    the more empathetic character, dramatically alters his appearance,
    he becomes the dominant person in the relationship.[[45]](#n45) \

    \
36. Train Man became the icon of the fashion industry targeting men, for
    advertisers realised the potential of *otaku* as a consumer force
    willing to spend money on hobbies and aware of the social status
    associated with brand-name goods. Especially after the *Train Man*
    television drama, manuals were published to help *otaku* become more
    attractive romantic partners. For example, the October 2005 *Datsu
    otaku fāshun gaido* (Fashion Guide for Otaku), written in manga
    format, is the story of an *otaku* who gets the girl because he
    learns how to dress.[[46]](#n46) The December 2005 *Densha otoko
    sutairingu baiburu* (Train Man Styling Bible for Otaku) is a
    compendium of winners chosen from 135 entries in a 2005 contest
    sponsored by the web company Apparel Click, open only to fashion
    academy students around the same age as Train Man, to design
    clothing outfits that would turn Akiba-kei *otaku* into '*Moe*-kei,'
    *otaku*. ('*Moe*' is common *otaku* slang for someone who is
    sexually attractive or 'hot.')[[47]](#n47) Although readers are most
    likely fashion designers and aficionados familiar with Apparel Click
    rather than the target consumers, these guides attempt to profit
    from the belief that all *otaku* are members of a subculture unified
    by shame, who desire to disguise themselves as a step to becoming
    more participatory members of larger society.[[48]](#n48) A main
    theme of *Train Man* is that it is okay to be an *otaku* so long as
    you do not look or act like one in public. \
     \
37. It is important to acknowledge that not all *otaku* have felt
    positively about the mentality depicted in *Train Man* or the
    discourse on masculinity it engendered. Many instead have expressed
    a sense of pride at being part of a community apart from greater
    society and were angered by the suggestion that they should change.
    For example, in his March 2005 400-page book manifesto that sold
    33,000 copies in its first three months, *Denpa otoko* (Radio Wave
    Man) and the September 2005 sequel *Denpa taisen* (Radio Wave
    Crusade), prolific journalist and self-proclaimed extreme *otaku*
    Honda Toru criticised *Train Man* for advancing the notion that
    *otaku* are inferior to members of mainstream culture and that they
    should transform their identities for what he scorned as 'love
    capitalism' (*renai-shihonshugi*) that might lead to unfulfilled
    desires.[[49]](#n49) Honda states Hermes should have been willing to
    change for Train Man, and he should have made her into an Akihabara
    *otaku*.[[50]](#n50) For example, in December 2005, the Akiba Blog,
    reported signs placed near sales displays of the *Train Man*
    television series DVD in Akihabara that 'Real Otaku Don't Desire
    Live 3-D Women.' Behind the extremely misogynistic slogan lay the
    idea that *otaku* might want to seek alternatives to mainstream
    visions of romance.[[51]](#n51) In one episode of the television
    drama *Akihabara@DEEP*, the *otaku* heroes discuss the impossibility
    of a relationship like that between Train Man and Hermes. \
     \
38. Blogs and websites also reflect the fact that *otaku* men are
    finding romantic partners in their own communities. Online dating
    sites have been founded to pair men and women with similar hobbies
    to share '*otaku* lifestyle together.'[[52]](#n52) This might also
    imply that female *otaku* are seen as equals to men, different from
    the way Hermes was objectified by Train Man's supporters. \
     \
39. Female *otaku* have received more media attention since around the
    time of the *Train Man* phenomenon, but, rather than being embroiled
    in discussions about the family, they have most often been showcased
    as a creative force of consumers and producers of Japan's
    flourishing manga and anime industries and as brave pioneer members
    of fandoms generally dominated by men. Although positive, these
    reports present female *otaku* as anomalies rather than role models
    and reveal aspects of gender segregation in *otaku* culture. There
    was a spate of articles about and guidebooks for female 'rail fans,'
    train enthusiasts (affectionately called '*tecchan*' or '*tekko*')
    when the TBS network aired a serialised television drama about the
    topic, *Tokkyu Tanaka san go* (Tanaka Express Number Three), watched
    by an average of only 9 percent of the national audience) on Friday
    nights in the spring of 2007.[[53]](#n53) The 'Otome Road' in
    Tokyo's Ikebukuro district offers shops for female *otaku*,
    including the Swallowtail butler café that was opened (perhaps in
    parody) as an alternative to the more numerous and popular maid
    cafés serving men.[[54]](#n54) \
     \
40. Lastly, Train Man has been perceived as the prototype of a suitable
    marriage partner for career women, a growing demographic blamed for
    marrying late. On one hand, Hermes exemplifies many of the
    characteristics of heroines of pure-love stories.[[55]](#n55) She is
    wealthy, for two Hermes teacups cost about $220. Especially in the
    film and television versions, she is portrayed as the daughter of an
    upper-middle-class family and earns her own income as a prominent
    company employee but seems willing to quit her job after marriage.
    She is compassionate and forgiving of others' character flaws.
    Additionally, in the serialised drama, Hermes speaks English
    fluently and travels abroad, shorthand ways to indicate a
    character's sophistication that have been conventions of Japanese
    television programs since the 1980s. \
     \
41. On the other hand, although the term is not stated in the story and
    the movie and television versions downplay the fact that Hermes is
    older than Train Man, Hermes represents the media figure of the
    'loser dog' (*make inu*), an unmarried woman in her thirties or
    forties who embraces her career and time with friends and spends
    money on fashionable entertainments or goods rather than on family.
    The term was popularised by Sakai Junko, prolific essayist and
    author of books on relationships, in her 2003 bestselling self-help
    book *Make inu no toboe* (Distant Howling of the Loser Dogs),
    written partly in response to the Japanese popularity of the
    American television program *Sex and the City*, which also depicts
    marriage as one of women's life goals. Th The lesser-used but more
    positive term for these women is '*ohitorisama*,' coined around 1999
    for women who dine by themselves in restaurants and adopted in
    feminist Ueno Chizuko's 2007 book *Ohitorisama no rōgo* (Growing Old
    Alone).[[56]](#n56) \
     \
42. Sakai advocates that 'No matter how successfully they are in their
    careers, unmarried women in their thirties are "loser dogs" until
    they find husbands or become single mothers. Wives and mothers are
    "winner dogs".'[[57]](#n57) Sakai advises that 'loser dogs' should
    continue to spend money on themselves and look fashionable to show
    that they are not ashamed of their single status and that it is be
    their own choice. Yet she admonishes that unmarried women in their
    thirties and forties keep in mind that Japanese society has changed
    since the Bubble Era, the time when they came of age. They should
    accordingly adjust the qualities that they stereotypically value in
    men, such as the ability to appear recognisably elite in urban
    society. In her 2005 humorous essay collection *Sono hito,
    dokushin?* (Still Single?), Sakai writes that the pairing of 'loser
    dogs' and the kind of *otaku* represented by Train Man, both of whom
    exemplify aspects of conspicuous consumption, may be a
    countermeasure to late marriage and falling birth rates.[[58]](#n58)
    \
     \
43. Overall, regardless of whether the story was based on real events or
    merely on the possibility that it could have happened, *Train Man*
    presents an important image of masculinity that arose from the
    interrelationship between new media, communities and a historical
    context of changing gender roles. *Train Man* has had a lasting
    influence on the ways that *otaku* culture has been examined in
    order to find possible solutions to, rather than merely being blamed
    for, pressing national issues and to understand twenty-first-century
    social and economic patterns. The trans-media phenomenon symbolises
    the power of online fan communities to establish cultural trends
    with larger political implications and reveals how the permeable
    boundaries between so-called mainstream Japan and its subcultures
    provide insight into contradictions inherent in the discourses
    underlying Japan's national growth. Few Internet novels in forms
    similar to *Train Man* have been published after 2006, perhaps
    because the trend is no longer as alluring. The book, however, has
    had an enduring impact upon the ways that stories have been written,
    marketed and consumed, as evident in the proliferation of cell-phone
    novels, and it has shaped television and film characters. While
    encouraging greater acceptance of communities that exist apart from
    larger public society, this tale of love, in the end, advocated
    conformity instead of alternative forms of marriage and family.
    While Train Man is an entertaining role model and exemplar of the
    power self-achievement, he has helped champion the social status
    quo. \

     [[8]](#t8) The term '*otaku*' has been credited to essayist
    Nakamori Akio (real name Shibahara Ansaku) in his 1983 series of
    '*Otaku* Investigations' (*Otaku no kenkyū*). The term originated
    from an honorific form of second-person address, which Nakamori
    noticed fans use in reference to each other. Miyazaki Tsutomu was
    arrested in July 1989 for killing four girls, aged four to seven,
    and being a sexual predator to other children. Because he possessed
    an exorbitant amount of anime and horror videos and discussed his
    murders in reference to these media, his case started a public panic
    about *otaku*. See, for example, Machiyama Tomohiro, 'Mondo Tokyo:
    *otaku*,' in *Cruising the Anime City: An Otaku Guide to Neo Tokyo*,
    ed. Patrick Macias and Tomohiro Machiyama, San Francisco: Stone
    Bridge Press, 2004, pp. 13–15, p. 14. \

     [[10]](#t10) The mainstream consumption of 2-Channel ASCII art is
    exemplified by the popularity of the Flash animated song 'Fight!
    Kikkoman,' which was based on the soy sauce brand name. In the song,
    an ASCII-art superhero fights food-related villains, including
    ketchup man, and teaches Giko neko the foods that taste best with
    soy sauce. The song was created by 2-Channel users and has no
    connection with the Kikkoman Company. I would like to thank Henry
    Oshiro for bringing this song to my attention. English explanations
    for the main characteristics and designs of ASCII art were featured
    in the May 2008 issue of *Wired* magazine. [Lisa

     [[39]](#t39) Late marriage has been attributed to a variety of

    Labor and Welfare Ministry, the percentage of unmarried men and

    impaired' woman and a 'brilliant but socially-challenged' man
    compete in an 'ultimate social experiment' for the chance to win a
    $250,000 prize. The 'missions' in the first season were strikingly
    similar to those in the *Train Man* story. As a plot twist in season
    four (2007), one of the couples comprised a male beauty and a female
    geek. According to the official program website, this reversal
    raised concerns whether the other men would feel intimidated and the
    women would try to give the 'geek' a cosmetic makeover. See CW
