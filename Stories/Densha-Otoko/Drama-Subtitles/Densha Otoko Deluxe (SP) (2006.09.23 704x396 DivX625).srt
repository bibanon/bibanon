1
00:00:05,452 --> 00:00:14,741
We're baaack

2
00:00:20,534 --> 00:00:22,216
Something's wrong with Akihabara!

3
00:00:22,216 --> 00:00:23,213
You're kidding!  Let's go check it out!

4
00:00:23,213 --> 00:00:24,051
<Domo arigato Mr. Robotto theme song>

5
00:00:24,051 --> 00:00:25,692
<Domo arigato Mr. Robotto theme song>

6
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,796
<Domo arigato Mr. Robotto theme song>

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,290
Transform into reentry mode!

8
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:35,650
Right on!

9
00:00:43,345 --> 00:00:45,553
"You're wondering who I am"

10
00:00:45,553 --> 00:00:48,177
"Secret secret, I've got a secret"

11
00:00:48,177 --> 00:00:50,635
"Machine or mannequin"

12
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:53,064
"Secret secret, I've got a secret"

13
00:00:53,064 --> 00:00:55,475
"With parts made in Japan"

14
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:58,100
"Secret secret, I've got a secret"

15
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,309
"I am the modern man"

16
00:01:17,918 --> 00:01:19,661
Atchan, what food can't you eat?

17
00:01:19,661 --> 00:01:20,920
Almond tofu and green peas.

18
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,941
Roger that.

19
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:24,133
Sorry to keep you waiting, master

20
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:27,210
"The Legit Maid Cafe"
-Getting around has been so difficult lately-

21
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,344
Now that Normal People have overrun the streets

22
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,066
Otakus like us have been scrutinized with their curious stares

23
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:35,616
If you walk around in Otaku gear...
You'll end up falling prety to those people!

24
00:01:35,616 --> 00:01:40,020
On my way here...
I was targeted by so many camera lenses

25
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,498
Akihabara

26
00:01:41,498 --> 00:01:45,281
It was once the Holy Land
of all Otakus

27
00:01:45,281 --> 00:01:49,078
However, with the Otaku boom,
Normal People started to flow in

28
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:52,767
The Otakus were losing
their place to call home

29
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:55,350
Time passed by...

30
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,298
2006 AD

31
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,251
The Otaku Holy Land of Akihabara

32
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:19,077
has changed drastically in the past year

33
00:02:19,077 --> 00:02:23,162
Today we'd like to see how Otakus feel about this

34
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:26,050
There they are!

35
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,853
Wearing backpacks and tucking in their shirts

36
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:31,001
Excuse me, if you don't mind

37
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:33,008
Is this an interview?

38
00:02:33,608 --> 00:02:36,743
In recent days, Akihabara has changed drastically

39
00:02:36,743 --> 00:02:39,273
...has any good come out of this transformation?

40
00:02:39,273 --> 00:02:41,571
There's nothing good!

41
00:02:41,571 --> 00:02:42,462
Okay

42
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:46,645
In that case, we'll show you the crisis faced by Akihabara!

43
00:02:46,645 --> 00:02:50,356
Maid cafes, unfortunately,
have become tourist attractions!

44
00:02:50,356 --> 00:02:52,441
Now, not only couples come...

45
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:54,274
but even kids taking a break from class trips!

46
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,758
Say cheese!

47
00:02:56,372 --> 00:02:57,165
In this...

48
00:02:57,165 --> 00:03:01,133
foreign place, us Otakus can't feel at home!

49
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:04,971
The oden cans, an Akihabara specialty,
are not only bought by Normal People

50
00:03:04,971 --> 00:03:08,968
but are regarded as scenic spots,
and we can't go buy them anymore!

51
00:03:08,968 --> 00:03:11,104
It's an otaku!

52
00:03:15,674 --> 00:03:17,775
Wait!  Hold on!

53
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:22,517
O.T.S.
(otaku smell detection system)

54
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:25,628
What the fuck?

55
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:28,297
Where'd that person go?

56
00:03:28,297 --> 00:03:29,422
Just between you and me...

57
00:03:29,422 --> 00:03:32,203
Some legit otakus who're tired of today's Akihabara

58
00:03:32,203 --> 00:03:35,153
are seeking refuge in the underground maid cafes

59
00:03:35,153 --> 00:03:36,339
Are you not going?

60
00:03:36,339 --> 00:03:37,834
No way!

61
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:39,603
I still have my otaku pride

62
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:42,854
Even if I'm the last one left on this planet

63
00:03:42,854 --> 00:03:49,029
I have no plans to let the spirit of my otaku culture wilt

64
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:51,453
Please stop!

65
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:55,218
I'm not some animal from the wild...
Please stop!

66
00:03:57,526 --> 00:03:59,187
What is it going to take to satisfy...

67
00:03:59,187 --> 00:04:02,733
your need to destroy our Holy Land!?

68
00:04:03,606 --> 00:04:05,820
Damn ota
("Ota" is short for, well, you know)

69
00:04:19,948 --> 00:04:21,312
Magnificent view

70
00:04:25,771 --> 00:04:27,401
President Maezono

71
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:30,539
Would you please reconsider just once more?

72
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,001
Yamazaki-san

73
00:04:34,911 --> 00:04:37,980
My answer is 'no,' regardless of how many times you ask

74
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,459
Please go back

75
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:03,249
Hello, Mr. Maezono

76
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:04,993
I warmed your seat for you

77
00:05:06,343 --> 00:05:07,760
What did you want?

78
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,660
Well, you see...

79
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,705
My dad's company went under,
and the bank took the bar that I managed

80
00:05:14,705 --> 00:05:16,067
and well, money...

81
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:17,228
I can't help you

82
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:19,734
Don't be a dick, man

83
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:22,091
I helped you out when you were in LA, remember?

84
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:23,859
Yes, I guess you did

85
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:24,498
That's right

86
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:26,121
Isn't that coat mine?

87
00:05:26,121 --> 00:05:27,935
Whoa, uhh, that's right

88
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:32,891
Okay, if you can give me something I could never get on my own...

89
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:34,304
I'll think about investing in your business

90
00:05:34,304 --> 00:05:35,486
Oh really?

91
00:05:35,486 --> 00:05:39,126
They don't call you the Wizard of Stocks for nothing

92
00:05:39,126 --> 00:05:41,810
You make the most eccentric comments

93
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,857
Oh wait, wait, there is!

94
00:05:44,857 --> 00:05:47,457
Something you could never get for the life of you!

95
00:05:47,457 --> 00:05:49,094
Hermes

96
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:50,905
No, not the Hermes brand

97
00:05:50,905 --> 00:05:52,824
Densha Otoko's Hermes?

98
00:05:52,824 --> 00:05:53,954
So you know about her...

99
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:55,758
Information is everything for our industry

100
00:05:55,758 --> 00:05:57,448
Of course I'd know about her.

101
00:05:57,448 --> 00:05:59,146
Well, then let's cut through the chase

102
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,223
Even you stand no chance...

103
00:06:04,223 --> 00:06:06,519
against Densha Otoko

104
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:20,636
I'm not that handsome

105
00:06:21,274 --> 00:06:23,537
Mr. Yamada!  Where were you?

106
00:06:23,537 --> 00:06:26,076
You had a chance to be on TV

107
00:06:26,076 --> 00:06:26,888
Uh, well...

108
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:28,687
Oh shoot, it's Densha Otoko!

109
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:30,860
They even made a movie about him...

110
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,898
but even now, his true identity remains a mystery

111
00:06:32,898 --> 00:06:36,240
Guitar Otoko exposed himself, but nobody really cared

112
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,166
How dare you!

113
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,581
Damn you, Mr. Kawamoto

114
00:06:39,581 --> 00:06:40,962
Miina Kick!

115
00:06:47,134 --> 00:06:48,485
Akihabara has really become...

116
00:06:48,485 --> 00:06:49,784
difficult to live in

117
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:53,051
Will we otakus continue to be labled as outcasts?

118
00:06:53,051 --> 00:06:55,206
Excuse me, but I have something important today

119
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,645
Was there an anime episode today?

120
00:06:56,645 --> 00:06:59,774
No, it's not that, but

121
00:06:59,774 --> 00:07:02,583
Excuse me.

122
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:08,443
Oh wait, we have something important to do today

123
00:07:08,443 --> 00:07:09,300
You're right

124
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,025
Today is the day Densha Otoko will propose to Hermes

125
00:07:13,814 --> 00:07:15,484
Hey wait a minute

126
00:07:15,484 --> 00:07:19,063
What if Mr. Yamada is Densha Otoko

127
00:07:21,092 --> 00:07:23,058
No way, no way!

128
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:37,959
Okay

129
00:07:40,406 --> 00:07:42,770
Sorry I'm late

130
00:08:00,774 --> 00:08:03,997
No it's okay, I just got here too

131
00:08:03,997 --> 00:08:05,745
Shall we go?

132
00:08:05,745 --> 00:08:06,908
Sure

133
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,817
Densha still isn't back

134
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:22,462
My girlfriend is tired of waiting

135
00:08:22,462 --> 00:08:26,334
I hope Densha's proposal goes well

136
00:08:26,868 --> 00:08:29,841
We cut our date short and are standing by

137
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:32,146
My wife and I are wondering where Densha is

138
00:08:32,146 --> 00:08:36,746
My wife too, but she went to her parents' home to have our baby

139
00:08:36,746 --> 00:08:41,358
Hey...
Aren't there lots of couples in this thread now?

140
00:08:46,758 --> 00:08:49,761
Images of your triumphant smiles flew by my head

141
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:52,186
This is where single guys spit out their bitterness!

142
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:54,358
Weren't we gonna be single to our death?

143
00:08:54,358 --> 00:08:55,166
Traitor!

144
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,466
Cut out the affection crap!

145
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:58,314
Don't pout, you virgin

146
00:08:58,314 --> 00:09:00,272
Man, a girlfriend...

147
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,800
I got home just now

148
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,135
Densha

149
00:09:05,135 --> 00:09:10,288
He's back!

150
00:09:24,175 --> 00:09:25,075
Densha Otoko DX
The last Holy War

151
00:09:25,075 --> 00:09:27,093
The visions dancing in my mind

152
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:30,691
The early dawn, the shades of time

153
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:35,786
Twilight crawling through
my windowpane

154
00:09:37,387 --> 00:09:38,383
Am I awake or do I dream?

155
00:09:38,383 --> 00:09:39,149
Am I awake or do I dream?

156
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:40,972
Am I awake or do I dream?

157
00:09:40,972 --> 00:09:41,712
The strangest pictures I have seen

158
00:09:41,712 --> 00:09:42,451
The strangest pictures I have seen

159
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:44,504
The strangest pictures I have seen

160
00:09:44,504 --> 00:09:45,224
Night is day and twilight's gone away

161
00:09:45,224 --> 00:09:46,312
Night is day and twilight's gone away

162
00:09:46,312 --> 00:09:48,603
Night is day and twilight's gone away

163
00:09:50,104 --> 00:09:51,430
With your head held high
and your scarlet lies

164
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,318
With your head held high
and your scarlet lies

165
00:09:53,318 --> 00:09:54,582
You came down to me
from the open skies

166
00:09:54,582 --> 00:09:56,465
You came down to me
from the open skies

167
00:09:57,392 --> 00:09:58,846
It's either real or it's a dream

168
00:09:58,846 --> 00:10:00,738
There's nothing that is in between...

169
00:10:00,738 --> 00:10:02,308
Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile

170
00:10:02,308 --> 00:10:03,306
Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile

171
00:10:03,306 --> 00:10:05,983
Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile

172
00:10:05,983 --> 00:10:06,361
Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile

173
00:10:07,798 --> 00:10:09,266
Twilight, I gave you
time to steal my mind

174
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:13,694
Twilight, I gave you
time to steal my mind

175
00:10:13,694 --> 00:10:17,520
Away from me.

178
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:38,170
Like I announced earlier,
I set out today..

179
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,237
To propose to Hermes

180
00:10:40,237 --> 00:10:41,855
Should I start with the results first?

181
00:10:41,855 --> 00:10:45,978
No!  Tease us like you did when you confessed to her!

182
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,831
We're all masochists here

183
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:51,445
Surely it went well this time

184
00:10:51,445 --> 00:10:52,928
They say the third time is the charm

185
00:10:52,928 --> 00:10:54,427
I can't wait for the good news

186
00:10:54,427 --> 00:10:56,757
Just to double check, Hermes isn't reading this, right?

187
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:58,308
He couldn't write here if she was

188
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:01,562
Right check, left check, you're all clear to go!

189
00:11:01,562 --> 00:11:03,741
The energy level is going up!

190
00:11:03,741 --> 00:11:05,665
Gimme the details, please!

191
00:11:08,531 --> 00:11:12,562
I spent 3 months' worth my salary on an engagement ring and set out

192
00:11:13,994 --> 00:11:18,865
And took her to where you told me to...
Joel Robuchon

193
00:11:18,865 --> 00:11:20,606
After our meal was over

194
00:11:20,606 --> 00:11:24,146
my nervousness maxed out

195
00:11:24,146 --> 00:11:25,526
Is something wrong?

196
00:11:26,492 --> 00:11:29,235
Is there something on my face?

197
00:11:29,235 --> 00:11:30,401
N, no

198
00:11:36,806 --> 00:11:39,900
Uhm...

199
00:11:40,277 --> 00:11:43,549
I, I, I have something to say to you

200
00:11:47,686 --> 00:11:50,829
W, w, w, will you

201
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:53,993
b, b, b, b, b...

202
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:56,566
b, b, b, b, b, b...

203
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:01,712
b...  b, b, b, b, b...

204
00:12:03,675 --> 00:12:06,931
believe in blood type fortune telling?

205
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,618
Y, yes

206
00:12:13,618 --> 00:12:14,879
I actually like it

207
00:12:15,915 --> 00:12:16,972
Is that so?

208
00:12:16,972 --> 00:12:22,284
Yuko told me an interesting story a few days ago

209
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:27,449
People's fates are decided before they're born

210
00:12:27,904 --> 00:12:29,087
I see

211
00:12:29,469 --> 00:12:31,720
Of course, that includes romance

212
00:12:33,618 --> 00:12:38,380
There's a country where your love life is inscribed...

213
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,124
in a pearl

214
00:12:41,124 --> 00:12:43,537
Romantic, isn't it?

215
00:12:45,135 --> 00:12:46,164
Yes, it is

216
00:12:46,164 --> 00:12:49,881
Your pearls and mine must have...

217
00:12:49,881 --> 00:12:53,582
the same writing inscribed on them

218
00:12:57,533 --> 00:12:59,684
Uh, um...

219
00:12:59,684 --> 00:13:02,320
I have something important to say to you

220
00:13:03,888 --> 00:13:05,824
Will you...

221
00:13:05,824 --> 00:13:09,431
m, m, m, m, m, m...

222
00:13:09,431 --> 00:13:11,047
m, m, m, m, m, m, m, m, m...

223
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:12,667
m, m, m, m, m, m...

224
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,321
m, m, m, m, m, m, m, m, m...

225
00:13:15,321 --> 00:13:17,923
m, m, m, m, m...

226
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,366
m, m, m, m, m, m, m, m, m...

227
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,631
m...

228
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,440
m, m, m, m, m...

229
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,074
marry me?

230
00:13:28,093 --> 00:13:29,758
Who the fuck would marry you?

231
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:31,657
You gotta be kidding

232
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:38,207
I...

233
00:13:38,207 --> 00:13:39,763
haven't changed a bit

234
00:13:39,763 --> 00:13:43,774
What are you saying?  You fought well

235
00:13:43,774 --> 00:13:45,540
Proposing is totally different from confessing

236
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,841
Don't rush -- take things one step at a time

237
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:51,676
Thanks

238
00:13:51,676 --> 00:13:56,412
I'll do my best!

239
00:14:31,786 --> 00:14:33,275
I'll leave the rest to you

240
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,183
Hello everyone

241
00:14:38,183 --> 00:14:42,442
We're looking to find the wherabouts of Densha Otoko

242
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:48,099
We'll give 10 million yen ($100,000 US) to anyone who can give us his whereabouts

243
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:48,622
Details will be posted on CyberNext's website

244
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:51,487
Details will be posted on CyberNext's website

245
00:14:51,487 --> 00:14:54,095
We await your information

246
00:14:59,576 --> 00:15:01,569
Cyber Next, isn't that...

247
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:07,026
the new IT company everyone's talking about?

248
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:10,403
10 million...  Kitaaaaa

249
00:15:10,403 --> 00:15:13,173
It's a website of a legit company, so this isn't a fluke

250
00:15:13,173 --> 00:15:16,194
Didn't Densha talk about himself before?

251
00:15:16,194 --> 00:15:20,014
I'll copy and paste what he wrote...
"I'm a regular Akihabara otaku

252
00:15:20,014 --> 00:15:22,228
Age: 23, annual income 3-4 million yen
($30k - $40k US)

253
00:15:22,228 --> 00:15:24,654
typical house, no car, fits right in to Akihabara"

254
00:15:24,654 --> 00:15:27,060
That means he's now 24!

255
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,530
If we all help out, we can expose him

256
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,147
Let's all exchange info, and agree not to hate on whoever catches him

257
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:34,060
I heard a rumor that Densha frequents...

258
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,530
...a maid cafe called Pinafore
(it really does exist)

259
00:15:39,615 --> 00:15:43,356
How weird...  Before it was just couples and schookids here

260
00:15:43,356 --> 00:15:45,854
Aren't people really edgy, too?

261
00:15:51,454 --> 00:15:53,577
Whoa, it's Densha Otoko!

262
00:15:57,429 --> 00:15:59,375
Aww man

263
00:16:03,217 --> 00:16:06,246
Densha Otoko sighting at the 6th Ishimaru Denki store!

264
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:07,944
Let's go!

265
00:16:17,424 --> 00:16:19,577
Did something happen?

266
00:16:19,577 --> 00:16:23,458
For today, we have an extra special guest...

267
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,117
Karin Takeda!

268
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,016
Hello everyone

269
00:16:27,911 --> 00:16:29,504
Say hello, everyone

270
00:16:29,504 --> 00:16:32,151
I heard Densha Otoko is a huge fan of Karin Takeda

271
00:16:32,151 --> 00:16:36,989
Okay okay, so you finished studying abroad in Los Angeles

272
00:16:36,989 --> 00:16:38,919
but did you hear about Densha Otoko?

273
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:41,541
Yeah, a lot of people there talked about it too

274
00:16:42,194 --> 00:16:47,566
Okay, so what if..
What if he was here in this crowd today?

275
00:16:48,195 --> 00:16:49,986
Hmmm...

276
00:16:49,986 --> 00:16:54,815
I'd like to tak him to my room and chat with him until morning

277
00:16:54,815 --> 00:16:56,831
Just the two of you?

278
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,896
So, Densha Otoko, what are you gonna do?

279
00:17:02,426 --> 00:17:03,736
I'm Densha Otoko

280
00:17:03,736 --> 00:17:05,815
No I'M Densha Otoko!

281
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,458
Oh wow

282
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:12,185
We can't tell who's the real Densha!

283
00:17:12,185 --> 00:17:15,963
If you're the real one, please smile and keep on jumping

284
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:25,754
If you're the real Densha, hold your breath until I tell you to breathe

285
00:17:30,043 --> 00:17:32,214
Karin...

286
00:17:32,214 --> 00:17:34,522
Karin?

287
00:17:34,522 --> 00:17:38,020
Uhh...  Karin?

288
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,053
Um...  Karin...?

289
00:17:42,053 --> 00:17:43,569
Until next time!

290
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:47,181
Karin-chan!  Tell them they can breathe now!

291
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:55,682
There's a good chance he uses the Chuo line

292
00:17:55,682 --> 00:17:57,858
Hey...  hey!

293
00:17:57,858 --> 00:18:02,510
Wasn't he at Takeda Karin's radio show?

294
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,371
He was, he was

295
00:18:04,371 --> 00:18:06,213
He might be Densha

296
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,451
Age: 23

297
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:16,863
Annual income: 3-4 million yen

298
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:19,565
No car, normal household, looks like he's from Akihabara

299
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,307
It all fits

300
00:18:21,307 --> 00:18:23,667
It would appear to be that way

301
00:18:26,957 --> 00:18:28,222
Hey wait!

302
00:18:31,867 --> 00:18:33,823
Shit!  Where'd he go?

303
00:18:33,823 --> 00:18:35,270
Go look over there

304
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:35,926
I'll check this way

305
00:18:35,926 --> 00:18:37,643
Sounds like a plan.
There's 10 million yen on the line

306
00:18:44,885 --> 00:18:46,333
10 million?

307
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:50,209
Something about Akihabara weirded me out today

308
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:53,537
I heard a lot of people say "Densha Otoko" and "10 million"

309
00:18:53,537 --> 00:18:55,012
You guys know anything?

310
00:18:55,012 --> 00:18:56,117
Please, serious replies only!

311
00:18:56,117 --> 00:18:57,927
You're finally back

312
00:18:57,927 --> 00:18:59,724
You won't believe what's happened

313
00:18:59,724 --> 00:19:05,301
Cyber Next is offering 10 million yen to whoever can find Densha Otoko

314
00:19:05,301 --> 00:19:07,298
Cyber Next?

315
00:19:08,952 --> 00:19:10,563
Win 10 million yen!
Find Densha Otoko!

316
00:19:11,826 --> 00:19:13,918
What is this?

317
00:19:13,918 --> 00:19:16,332
I found a guy at a maid cafe who fits Densha's description

318
00:19:16,332 --> 00:19:18,480
There's a good chance that Densha wears glasses at Akihabara

319
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,695
We saw someone suspicious at Karin Takeda's radio show

320
00:19:21,695 --> 00:19:24,036
We lost him at Musashi-sakai

321
00:19:24,036 --> 00:19:25,741
Aren't these guys...

322
00:19:25,741 --> 00:19:28,273
Let's all go to Musashi-sakai tomorrow

323
00:19:28,273 --> 00:19:30,792
We have to find everyone who fits Densha's description!

324
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:32,355
We'll call this...

325
00:19:32,355 --> 00:19:33,947
The Hunt for Densha Otoko

326
00:19:33,947 --> 00:19:37,158
The Hunt for Densha Otoko?

327
00:19:37,158 --> 00:19:39,670
The Hunt for Densha Otoko?

328
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:42,549
Why are they doing this...

329
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:44,838
You're definitely a celebrity now

330
00:19:44,838 --> 00:19:47,090
You're the star of hope for all otakus

331
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,761
Plus, they find you and get 10 million

332
00:19:48,761 --> 00:19:51,656
I bet Cyber Next is using you to raise their stock price

333
00:19:51,656 --> 00:19:53,969
They have no morals -- they're totally making fools out of otakus

334
00:19:53,969 --> 00:19:58,464
In any case, you'll be done for if they find you

335
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,800
What's so bad about being found?

336
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,074
You dimwit!

337
00:20:02,074 --> 00:20:04,006
Terrible things are gonna happen

338
00:20:04,006 --> 00:20:08,105
Photos of you and your private information might float across the internet

339
00:20:08,105 --> 00:20:10,192
Not to mention Hermes's photos

340
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:12,669
Then, without a doubt, you can kiss your private life good-bye

341
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,205
Strangers' inquisitive eyes will stare at you all day long

342
00:20:15,205 --> 00:20:17,789
Your family members and coworkers might run into trouble too

343
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:21,265
Yonesuke is gonna show up and eat your dinner!
(Yonesuke is a Japanese comedian)

344
00:20:21,265 --> 00:20:23,505
Of course, Hermes will be targeted, too

345
00:20:23,505 --> 00:20:25,934
She'll show up in otakus' fantasies

346
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:26,378
Fantasies?
Hermes...  Hermes...  HERMES

347
00:20:26,378 --> 00:20:28,353
Hermes...  Hermes...  HERMES

348
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:30,730
I can guarantee she'll be the target of everything on the internet

349
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,710
Sickos who imagined Hermes as their girlfriend...

350
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:37,123
might show up one day and stab you!

351
00:20:37,123 --> 00:20:38,091
Oh no...

352
00:20:38,091 --> 00:20:39,066
Now you understand?

353
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:41,586
These are hypothetical situations, but not entirely unreal

354
00:20:41,586 --> 00:20:43,732
Always anticipate your enemies' next move

355
00:20:43,732 --> 00:20:46,138
End all phone conversations in 30 seconds to fend off wire tappers

356
00:20:46,138 --> 00:20:49,858
If you're going to go out, be extra careful

357
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,512
Can't wait until tomorrow's movie

358
00:21:06,457 --> 00:21:09,009
Conversations in 30 seconds...

359
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:19,070
Sorry to call you so late

360
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,750
No it's okay -- is something wrong?

361
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,594
Tomorrow's movie...  Can we cancel it?

362
00:21:26,846 --> 00:21:30,716
That's fine, but did something happen?

363
00:21:31,865 --> 00:21:37,485
It's just that you rarely bail out on me at the last moment

364
00:21:37,485 --> 00:21:39,474
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry

365
00:21:39,474 --> 00:21:42,255
No, it's okay

366
00:21:42,255 --> 00:21:46,675
Um, okay, so...  Good night!

367
00:21:50,245 --> 00:21:52,422
29 seconds...

368
00:21:52,422 --> 00:21:54,137
That was close...

369
00:22:04,226 --> 00:22:06,137
Hey, this...

370
00:22:06,137 --> 00:22:08,276
Is this some kind of joke?

371
00:22:08,276 --> 00:22:09,729
I'm doing this to protect my family

372
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:13,950
You're troubling that very same family

373
00:22:14,821 --> 00:22:17,996
What the hell is going on here?

374
00:22:17,996 --> 00:22:19,140
What are you talking about?

375
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,856
Oh yeah, next Sunday

376
00:22:21,856 --> 00:22:23,682
can you lend me...

377
00:22:23,682 --> 00:22:24,796
your Hermes teacup set?

378
00:22:26,988 --> 00:22:28,270
Hey, what the hell?

379
00:22:32,172 --> 00:22:34,029
What do you want?

380
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:34,976
Enoki

381
00:22:34,976 --> 00:22:36,018
Tsudanuma

382
00:22:36,018 --> 00:22:37,187
Funabashi

383
00:22:37,187 --> 00:22:37,454
Ichikawa

384
00:22:37,454 --> 00:22:39,228
Hey Village Elder, what's with that outfit?

385
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:42,356
Help us out with this game, Village Elder

386
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,483
You can't cross here with the boat

387
00:22:50,483 --> 00:22:52,204
You have to go back to the tower of shadows...

388
00:22:56,813 --> 00:22:57,557
He's running away

389
00:22:57,557 --> 00:22:59,195
That's Densha Otoko!

390
00:22:59,195 --> 00:23:00,017
Densha Otoko?

391
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:02,512
10 million!

392
00:23:02,512 --> 00:23:03,854
Wait!  10 million!

393
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,830
We will offer 10 million yen

394
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:31,910
What the fuck do you mean,
'capture Densha Otoko!?'

395
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,240
Why didn't you tell me?

396
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:33,854
I did

397
00:23:33,854 --> 00:23:35,856
I asked you to tell me who Densha was

398
00:23:35,856 --> 00:23:38,248
I didn't know about the 10 million yen offer

399
00:23:38,248 --> 00:23:40,120
So what if you knew about it?

400
00:23:40,979 --> 00:23:42,517
Is it not too late?

401
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:49,391
Huh?  Am I not hunted anymore?

402
00:23:49,391 --> 00:23:53,998
Cyber Next's website had a post saying they called off the search for Densha

403
00:23:53,998 --> 00:23:54,812
Awesome

404
00:23:54,812 --> 00:23:56,973
But why did they call it off after only a few days?

405
00:23:56,973 --> 00:23:58,536
Wasn't that just a PR stunt?

406
00:23:58,536 --> 00:24:01,045
They're just trying to inflate their stock price

407
00:24:01,045 --> 00:24:03,744
You think someone found out Densha Otoko's identity?

408
00:24:06,518 --> 00:24:07,269
What am I gonna do?

409
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:08,591
If they found out I'm Densha...

410
00:24:09,654 --> 00:24:11,714
Calm down, it's just a possibility

411
00:24:11,714 --> 00:24:14,633
Even if that were so, don't you think they would...

412
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:16,555
contact you before releasing the info to the public?

413
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:19,472
If there was a winner, they might release Densha's info on the internet anyway

414
00:24:19,472 --> 00:24:21,469
There still might be scavengers after the prize money

415
00:24:21,469 --> 00:24:25,088
With or without the money, people might be interested in who Densha really is

416
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,147
We still don't know Cyber Next's motives behind this

417
00:24:28,147 --> 00:24:31,447
I think you'd better hold off on seeing Hermes for a while

418
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,994
I understand

419
00:24:34,994 --> 00:24:37,087
I'll hold off from seeing her a little while longer

420
00:24:46,066 --> 00:24:47,410
Grandpa

421
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:50,801
What happened?

422
00:24:50,801 --> 00:24:51,302
Come inside

423
00:24:51,302 --> 00:24:52,380
No, no

424
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,166
Right here is fine

425
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:56,921
I have a favor to ask you

426
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,072
Me?

427
00:25:00,072 --> 00:25:05,326
I want you to accompany me to lunch with a client of mine

428
00:25:07,454 --> 00:25:10,073
That's a blind date for sure

429
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:11,185
You think so?

430
00:25:11,185 --> 00:25:13,281
You said no, right?

431
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:21,014
My grandpa begged me to, so I couldn't say no

432
00:25:21,014 --> 00:25:22,770
Did you tell Tsuyoshi Yamada?

433
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:26,122
I wanted to talk to him, but...

434
00:25:26,122 --> 00:25:30,397
He hasn't been able to see me lately

435
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:35,412
Nobody following me

436
00:25:43,097 --> 00:25:44,484
You're finally back

437
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:47,726
This is Saori-san's grandfather

438
00:25:50,713 --> 00:25:52,742
Excuse me

439
00:25:52,742 --> 00:25:56,052
It's embarassing, but even at this age I had another child

440
00:25:56,052 --> 00:25:57,596
Please, enjoy

441
00:25:58,035 --> 00:26:01,643
Matilda!  Matilda!

442
00:26:01,952 --> 00:26:04,513
Saori-san's grandfather...

443
00:26:08,383 --> 00:26:09,584
N, nice to meet you

444
00:26:09,584 --> 00:26:11,716
I...  I'm Saori-san's...

445
00:26:11,716 --> 00:26:14,292
Are you Densha Otoko?

446
00:26:15,224 --> 00:26:17,224
How do you...

447
00:26:17,224 --> 00:26:17,996
Well...

448
00:26:17,996 --> 00:26:22,042
I had a request of you

449
00:26:22,042 --> 00:26:25,188
Can you break up with Saori?

450
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:31,310
Someone told me about the Densha Otoko hunting

451
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,263
Does Saori-san know?

452
00:26:33,263 --> 00:26:35,858
I could never tell her

453
00:26:35,858 --> 00:26:38,421
It would only frighten her

454
00:26:38,421 --> 00:26:41,000
I'm sorry

455
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,434
If something happened to my granddaughter, it would break my heart

456
00:26:47,434 --> 00:26:48,477
Please understand

457
00:26:48,477 --> 00:26:48,848
But...

458
00:26:48,848 --> 00:26:56,103
Then let me ask you, do you have the confidence to protect Saori, no matter what?

459
00:26:59,302 --> 00:27:01,560
In the end, I couldn't reply back

460
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,100
Grandpa Hermes, huh?

461
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,472
Now that's a dark horse for you

462
00:27:04,472 --> 00:27:06,950
It's a new obstacle between you two

463
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,780
What'll it take for him to accept you?

464
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:13,902
You have to convince him that you're a dependable guy

465
00:27:13,902 --> 00:27:17,869
I think I couldn't respond because I'm not confident in myself

466
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:20,530
I can't be a dependable guy...

467
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,740
Then build up that self-confidence

468
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,346
Become successful at your job

469
00:27:24,346 --> 00:27:25,755
Join the army!

470
00:27:25,755 --> 00:27:26,374
Drink some protein juice!

471
00:27:26,374 --> 00:27:28,667
You'll feel more confident if you go to Tenjiku and obtain the sutra

472
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:32,618
Go to Iskandar and obtain the anti-radiation device there

473
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:35,155
What about obtaining the black pearl of fate?

474
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:37,336
The black pearl of fate?

475
00:27:37,336 --> 00:27:39,321
It's a hoax that floated around the internet for a while

476
00:27:39,321 --> 00:27:43,798
When you hold it up to the sun, you see your future in romance inscribed...

477
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:46,063
on the inside of the black pearl

478
00:27:46,063 --> 00:27:48,304
Your first love, bitter separation, a new love

479
00:27:48,304 --> 00:27:50,366
and marrying the one dearest to you

480
00:27:50,366 --> 00:27:55,591
It's all inscribed in the black pearl

481
00:27:55,591 --> 00:28:03,671
Our pearls must have...
the same writing inscribed on them

482
00:28:03,671 --> 00:28:05,469
I heard about that before

483
00:28:05,469 --> 00:28:09,124
So is there a black pearl that tells the future of my love life?

484
00:28:09,124 --> 00:28:12,357
Of course, there's a black pearl for every one of us

485
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,618
How romantic?

486
00:28:13,618 --> 00:28:17,021
When you tell your name and birthday to the sage who guards them

487
00:28:17,021 --> 00:28:19,878
You can obtain the black pearl

488
00:28:19,878 --> 00:28:22,348
It's as unbelievable as the Loch Ness Monster

489
00:28:22,348 --> 00:28:25,124
I've never seen anyone who actually has one

490
00:28:25,124 --> 00:28:32,314
But wouldn't it be great if it said that you were going to marry Hermes?

491
00:28:32,314 --> 00:28:34,655
Where's the black pearl?

492
00:28:34,655 --> 00:28:36,765
Whoa, don't take us seriously

493
00:28:36,765 --> 00:28:39,436
Apparently a sage who lives deep in the jungle of Tahiti...

494
00:28:39,436 --> 00:28:42,971
watches over the black pearls,
but not much is known

495
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:43,960
Where's Tahiti?

496
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,241
It's a French Polynesian island
in the South Pacific

497
00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:49,530
it's a paradise that's a popular honeymoon spot

498
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,759
Good job on the info

499
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:52,432
It sounds like you have to go there and find out

500
00:28:52,432 --> 00:28:54,690
Don't take this rumor seriously

501
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,365
There are some shady ones out there

502
00:28:56,365 --> 00:28:58,090
And you don't know if the outcome will be good

503
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:00,186
Think of something else

504
00:29:04,595 --> 00:29:08,826
Actually, there's been a part of me that wondered...

505
00:29:08,826 --> 00:29:11,806
if I'm fit to be Hermes's husband

506
00:29:11,806 --> 00:29:13,318
And then today

507
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:16,422
her grandfather asked me

508
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:18,031
and my insecurity only grows

509
00:29:19,339 --> 00:29:22,443
So now, I would really do anything I can

510
00:29:22,443 --> 00:29:24,282
I want to look for the black pearl and find out...

511
00:29:24,935 --> 00:29:28,983
the future that awaits us

512
00:29:28,983 --> 00:29:31,397
If the result is good, I'll be confident

513
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:47,594
I'm going to Tahiti...
to find the black pearl!

514
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,969
300...?
(100 yen = $1)

515
00:30:17,597 --> 00:30:19,560
Loveless Restaurant

516
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,202
The Misuzu Jinkama Victim's Club...

517
00:30:22,202 --> 00:30:24,391
has gone global

518
00:30:24,391 --> 00:30:25,597
China

519
00:30:25,597 --> 00:30:26,590
Thailand

520
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,521
India

521
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:28,683
Iran

522
00:30:28,683 --> 00:30:30,116
Saudi Arabia

523
00:30:30,116 --> 00:30:31,911
The Vatican

524
00:30:31,911 --> 00:30:33,702
Spain

525
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:37,154
Oikawa-san

526
00:30:37,154 --> 00:30:41,229
I need some quick cash,
so I'd like to work part-time after hours

527
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:44,938
Sure, that's fine

528
00:30:44,938 --> 00:30:46,460
Thank you

529
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,501
Take those shutters away!

530
00:30:55,674 --> 00:30:58,336
Jinkama-san must be in Germany right now

531
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:03,557
Yamada!

532
00:31:03,557 --> 00:31:06,216
Bring the monkey wrench!

533
00:31:23,769 --> 00:31:25,795
Here you go

534
00:31:25,795 --> 00:31:27,460
Man, you're slow

535
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,207
Just go home

536
00:31:29,207 --> 00:31:30,595
Here, here's your payment

537
00:31:31,044 --> 00:31:32,609
30th anniversary
Raffle tickets

538
00:31:32,609 --> 00:31:34,840
Am I fired?

539
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,895
Hey Carl!  Bring me the pliers!

540
00:31:52,831 --> 00:31:54,356
It was nice working with you

541
00:31:56,974 --> 00:31:58,456
Now that's an otaku if I ever saw one

542
00:31:58,863 --> 00:32:00,381
He'll never have a girlfriend

543
00:32:01,406 --> 00:32:02,667
Excuse me

544
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,002
Um, what can we do for you?

545
00:32:06,002 --> 00:32:07,833
Where's Tsuyoshi Yamada?

546
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:10,231
Yamada just left

547
00:32:10,231 --> 00:32:14,026
I see..  Thank you

548
00:32:14,026 --> 00:32:15,949
Excuse me

549
00:32:15,949 --> 00:32:17,559
Forgive me for prying...

550
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:19,411
but you two are...

551
00:32:19,411 --> 00:32:21,805
He's my boyfriend

552
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:27,801
Thank you, come again

553
00:32:27,801 --> 00:32:30,161
Show us your raffle ticket

554
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:31,573
for your chance to win big!

555
00:32:31,573 --> 00:32:32,843
Right over here!

556
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:35,763
1st place -- an LCD TV!

557
00:32:35,763 --> 00:32:36,585
Take it home

558
00:32:36,585 --> 00:32:39,260
It's yours now -- go for it!

559
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,697
The red ball for the TV

560
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:42,801
If I sell it I could fund my trip

561
00:32:42,801 --> 00:32:44,750
Okay 3 times
Good luck!

562
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,957
Sorry

563
00:32:47,957 --> 00:32:49,239
Here, a sponge!

564
00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:50,414
Try again

565
00:32:51,598 --> 00:32:53,619
Here, a sponge!

566
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:55,062
Your last chance -- good luck!

567
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,926
Oh crap, no TV

568
00:32:59,975 --> 00:33:00,966
You win!

569
00:33:00,966 --> 00:33:02,318
You won the special prize...
Tickets for two...

570
00:33:02,318 --> 00:33:04,254
To Tahiti!

571
00:33:05,197 --> 00:33:07,091
To Tahiti?

572
00:33:07,091 --> 00:33:08,010
Congratulations!

573
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,646
Here are your tickets

574
00:33:22,093 --> 00:33:24,087
Long time no see

575
00:33:27,073 --> 00:33:28,359
Jinkama-san

576
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:29,964
Weren't you in Germany?

577
00:33:29,964 --> 00:33:31,973
Well, the German frankfurters...

578
00:33:31,973 --> 00:33:35,251
They weren't as great as I had hoped

579
00:33:35,251 --> 00:33:36,341
You got tired of eating them?

580
00:33:36,341 --> 00:33:38,256
Tahiti, huh?

581
00:33:38,256 --> 00:33:39,884
The last paradise?

582
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:41,200
Sounds pretty exciting

583
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,808
No, give it back please

584
00:33:43,627 --> 00:33:44,629
You're so annoying

585
00:33:44,629 --> 00:33:45,715
Give it back!

586
00:33:45,715 --> 00:33:50,146
Here, I'll scrub you with the sponge

587
00:33:50,146 --> 00:33:51,631
Ouch!

588
00:33:51,631 --> 00:33:53,450
Jinkama-san

589
00:34:02,775 --> 00:34:04,135
Canned tuna, check

590
00:34:04,135 --> 00:34:05,687
Swimming trunks, check

591
00:34:05,687 --> 00:34:07,283
Matilda, check

592
00:34:07,283 --> 00:34:08,631
Canned tuna, check

593
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:09,867
Swimming trunks, check

594
00:34:09,867 --> 00:34:11,129
Matil...

595
00:34:18,344 --> 00:34:19,661
Hello?

596
00:34:19,661 --> 00:34:21,262
Sorry to call you so late

597
00:34:22,262 --> 00:34:23,447
No problem

598
00:34:23,447 --> 00:34:25,084
I was just about to call you too

599
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,303
Well...

600
00:34:29,303 --> 00:34:32,465
I'm going to that South Pacific island...
Hitachi

601
00:34:32,465 --> 00:34:34,199
Hitachi?

602
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:37,112
You sure it's not Tahiti?

603
00:34:37,112 --> 00:34:40,227
Oh...  You're right, Tahiti

604
00:34:41,864 --> 00:34:43,967
Are you going with someone?

605
00:34:45,348 --> 00:34:48,923
Well...
It would take me a while to explain...

606
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:51,252
I see...

607
00:34:53,828 --> 00:34:57,172
Saori-san, you wanted to talk to me?

608
00:34:57,172 --> 00:34:59,513
We can talk when you come back

609
00:34:59,513 --> 00:35:01,872
Please enjoy your trip

610
00:35:10,758 --> 00:35:14,027
I takled to Hermes just now

611
00:35:14,027 --> 00:35:16,172
I couldn't tell her my reason for going to Tahiti

612
00:35:16,172 --> 00:35:17,775
Should I have told her?

613
00:35:17,775 --> 00:35:18,458
Don't worry about it

614
00:35:18,458 --> 00:35:20,124
You're going to boost your self-confidence

615
00:35:20,124 --> 00:35:21,821
Just tell her after you come back

616
00:35:21,821 --> 00:35:23,685
Just think about Tahiti for now

617
00:35:23,685 --> 00:35:26,907
Have you ever been overseas?

618
00:35:28,967 --> 00:35:30,226
N, no...

619
00:35:30,226 --> 00:35:32,816
Come to think of it,
I was so focused on the black pearls...

620
00:35:32,816 --> 00:35:36,134
I didn't think that far ahead

621
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,259
I...  What should I do?

622
00:35:38,259 --> 00:35:40,852
Take it easy.
I figured as much, and looked stuff up for you

623
00:35:40,852 --> 00:35:44,231
I bought a guide book at the book store

624
00:35:44,231 --> 00:35:46,391
Go to Narita airport, not Haneda

625
00:35:46,391 --> 00:35:48,945
Just make sure you don't get on
"Super Hitachi" (a train)

626
00:35:48,945 --> 00:35:50,253
Joban line...  Kitaaaaa

627
00:35:50,253 --> 00:35:52,687
Make sure to check beforehand if you need to tip people

628
00:35:52,687 --> 00:35:55,608
Put the curtains on the inside when you shower

629
00:35:55,608 --> 00:35:56,690
Don't take a dump on the bidet!

630
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:57,818
You have your pickled plums?

631
00:35:57,818 --> 00:35:58,697
You brush your teeth?

632
00:35:58,697 --> 00:35:59,475
You do your homework?

633
00:35:59,475 --> 00:36:00,138
See you next week

634
00:36:00,138 --> 00:36:02,484
"Don't finish yet,"
he exclaimed.

635
00:36:02,484 --> 00:36:05,321
If you listen to what we tell you,
you'll for sure be fine

636
00:36:05,321 --> 00:36:10,427
Henceforth this will be...
Densha Otoko Overseas Travel Project

637
00:36:11,441 --> 00:36:13,287
Densha Otoko
Overseas
Travel Project

638
00:36:15,957 --> 00:36:17,683
Travelling overseas carries many dangers

639
00:36:17,683 --> 00:36:22,867
As soon as you set foot on the airport,
think that everyone is your enemy!

640
00:36:22,867 --> 00:36:25,421
Nobody's gonna steal your stuff!

641
00:36:25,421 --> 00:36:26,808
There's no way to be certain

642
00:36:26,808 --> 00:36:30,137
There are many things in here...
that I value more than my life!

643
00:36:30,137 --> 00:36:33,267
This dirty figure too?

644
00:36:33,267 --> 00:36:37,665
I took this because I didn't want this Matilda to be eaten by the Matilda at home

645
00:36:37,665 --> 00:36:40,895
I'm not sure what you're talking about
but don't get on the wrong flight

646
00:36:40,895 --> 00:36:42,507
What?  We're not boarding together?

647
00:36:42,507 --> 00:36:45,076
Of course I'm not riding economy class

648
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:52,834
Take off your shoes when boarding the plane

649
00:36:52,834 --> 00:36:55,035
...is something even a child wouldn't do

650
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:58,785
It's a plane bound for Tahiti, so...

651
00:37:01,732 --> 00:37:04,420
What a coincidence!
I'm going to Tahiti, too!

652
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,413
...shouldn't be said

653
00:37:08,845 --> 00:37:10,700
The windows won't open!

654
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:17,509
Uh, excuse me

655
00:37:17,509 --> 00:37:20,302
Could you let me know when we see...
the International Date Line?

656
00:37:24,002 --> 00:37:28,463
To wish Densha Otoko well on his travels
All hands...  Salute!

657
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:11,841
I HATE this...
Couples everywhere!

658
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:13,225
Hold my stuff, will ya?

659
00:38:14,129 --> 00:38:15,242
Excuse me

660
00:38:15,945 --> 00:38:18,068
Can you take a picture for me please?

661
00:38:18,068 --> 00:38:18,428
Sure

662
00:38:23,122 --> 00:38:24,715
Say cheese

663
00:38:27,968 --> 00:38:29,358
Thank you

664
00:38:30,228 --> 00:38:31,318
Excuse me

665
00:38:31,318 --> 00:38:33,045
Can you take a picture of me please?

666
00:38:39,267 --> 00:38:40,795
Thank you so much

667
00:39:05,919 --> 00:39:07,115
Misuzu-san is mine!

668
00:39:10,249 --> 00:39:12,099
How dare you, right on our honeymoon!

669
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:12,995
Unforgivable!

670
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,859
Shot 2!

671
00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:16,178
Unbelievable!

672
00:39:16,178 --> 00:39:17,926
What the hell!

673
00:39:17,926 --> 00:39:19,548
You piss me off!

674
00:39:22,511 --> 00:39:24,075
Why me?

675
00:39:56,357 --> 00:39:57,597
What are you doing?

676
00:39:57,597 --> 00:39:59,354
You have such an otaku body

677
00:40:00,281 --> 00:40:02,804
Why don't you learn a thing or two from those guys?

678
00:40:02,804 --> 00:40:03,839
What are you...

679
00:40:04,464 --> 00:40:07,116
You know, I heard something

680
00:40:07,116 --> 00:40:09,727
There's a Man of the Black Pearl in this country

681
00:40:11,223 --> 00:40:14,470
His balls are supposed to be amazing

682
00:40:19,983 --> 00:40:21,178
What are you doing?

683
00:40:23,526 --> 00:40:25,083
Ouch!

684
00:40:41,867 --> 00:40:42,948
Tsuyoshi!

685
00:40:42,948 --> 00:40:45,005
You'll for sure find the black pearl of fate!

686
00:40:45,005 --> 00:40:50,344
The tour to find the black pearl of fate
will depart in a few moments

687
00:40:53,114 --> 00:40:56,836
Um, so if I join this...
Can I find the black pearl of fate?

688
00:40:56,836 --> 00:40:58,362
Yes, of course

689
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,700
Yamada!

690
00:41:08,124 --> 00:41:10,027
Why are you in uniform?

691
00:41:21,419 --> 00:41:24,365
The black pearl of fate might be in the ocean

692
00:41:32,139 --> 00:41:33,736
Okay

693
00:41:57,286 --> 00:42:00,147
Okay, here are your black pearls of fate

694
00:42:00,147 --> 00:42:01,160
Yamashita-san

695
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:01,783
They're not in the ocean?

696
00:42:01,783 --> 00:42:04,146
Matsuda-san

697
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:05,529
Yamada-san

698
00:42:10,802 --> 00:42:12,950
This is the fated...

699
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,672
black pearl!

700
00:42:17,348 --> 00:42:19,250
Happiness forever

701
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:21,858
in Tahiti?

702
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,675
Excuse me

703
00:42:26,675 --> 00:42:31,082
My black pearl doesn't have anything about
my future love or my romantic fortune

704
00:42:31,082 --> 00:42:37,345
There's no way a pearl this small would show that!  You're such a clown

705
00:43:00,367 --> 00:43:02,252
They've got a lot of meat

706
00:43:02,252 --> 00:43:04,778
but not where it counts

707
00:43:04,778 --> 00:43:07,509
Jinkama-san...
What're you doing?

708
00:43:07,509 --> 00:43:08,525
Yeah, I was doing it...

709
00:43:08,525 --> 00:43:13,747
but they can't compare to
the Man of the Black Pearl

710
00:43:13,747 --> 00:43:14,561
Speaking of a black pearl

711
00:43:14,561 --> 00:43:17,515
did you see one around here?

712
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:19,322
You mean this?

713
00:43:19,322 --> 00:43:21,164
Yes, that!
Can you give it back please?

714
00:43:28,535 --> 00:43:29,255
Yamada?

715
00:43:29,255 --> 00:43:30,477
Me?

716
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:37,719
They say that there are 3 people in the world who look like you...

717
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:40,026
but he really does resemble you

718
00:43:40,026 --> 00:43:42,131
Enough of that
We have to administer CPR

719
00:43:42,131 --> 00:43:43,934
Why the fuck do I have to do that?

720
00:43:43,934 --> 00:43:46,460
It's you're fault he's like this!

721
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,283
Okay

722
00:43:47,283 --> 00:43:48,669
I'll do it, I'll do it

723
00:44:01,499 --> 00:44:02,562
What're you doing?

724
00:44:02,562 --> 00:44:06,565
It pisses me off to look at his face

725
00:44:07,404 --> 00:44:10,060
He's saved!

726
00:44:11,154 --> 00:44:12,570
T...  Thank you

727
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:13,871
You bet

728
00:44:13,871 --> 00:44:17,605
If I didn't save you

729
00:44:17,605 --> 00:44:19,750
Hey wait, you speak Japanese?

730
00:44:20,963 --> 00:44:22,962
Yes

731
00:44:22,962 --> 00:44:25,899
I'm TuyoTam, a travel guide

732
00:44:25,899 --> 00:44:27,780
Bullshit

733
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,641
A fake?

734
00:44:32,641 --> 00:44:35,892
Many black pearls of fate
made for tourists they are

735
00:44:36,518 --> 00:44:39,293
Real ones difficult to get

736
00:44:39,293 --> 00:44:40,798
Where are the real ones?

737
00:44:40,798 --> 00:44:42,729
Deep in mountains

738
00:44:42,729 --> 00:44:44,817
Deep deep in mountains

739
00:44:44,817 --> 00:44:45,717
But

740
00:44:45,717 --> 00:44:47,883
dangerous it is

741
00:44:47,883 --> 00:44:50,743
I really want it.
Please tell me!

742
00:44:50,743 --> 00:44:52,990
Why want it you do?

743
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,937
That...

744
00:44:57,841 --> 00:45:01,311
I want someone to push my back

745
00:45:02,828 --> 00:45:06,046
I want to know that even someone like me

746
00:45:06,046 --> 00:45:08,758
can be with the woman I love

747
00:45:08,758 --> 00:45:10,851
I want that kind of confidence

748
00:45:16,243 --> 00:45:18,866
My house, has map it does

749
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:21,041
Go find pearl you can

750
00:45:29,624 --> 00:45:31,410
Black pearl

751
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:33,937
Found at Tahai island

752
00:45:33,937 --> 00:45:37,253
Road to cave where sage is,
very scary, dangerous

753
00:45:38,371 --> 00:45:39,319
Jungle

754
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:42,447
Feared even by locals

755
00:45:42,447 --> 00:45:45,202
But, okay it is

756
00:45:45,202 --> 00:45:47,755
Everything written down I have
Read it carefully

757
00:45:47,755 --> 00:45:49,989
Thanks, TuyoTam

758
00:45:49,989 --> 00:45:53,120
Okay...  I'm off!

759
00:46:09,758 --> 00:46:12,346
You know so much about it

760
00:46:12,346 --> 00:46:16,082
Yes.  Get black pearl, once I did

761
00:46:16,082 --> 00:46:19,209
So, is the Man of the Black Pearl there too?

762
00:46:20,435 --> 00:46:21,534
Not there

763
00:46:21,534 --> 00:46:22,567
Then where?

764
00:46:23,507 --> 00:46:27,993
Right here

765
00:46:33,057 --> 00:46:34,856
You've gotta be kidding

766
00:46:48,059 --> 00:46:53,472
At the base of that mountain...
The black pearl!

767
00:46:57,299 --> 00:46:58,665
Tahai people

768
00:46:58,665 --> 00:47:00,133
Guardians of island

769
00:47:00,133 --> 00:47:02,932
Very hostile to outsiders

770
00:47:02,932 --> 00:47:06,070
Sacrifice you they will
if you commit a mistake

771
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,598
Skulls you may find

772
00:47:08,598 --> 00:47:12,236
This is the 21st century
There's no way that's real

773
00:47:25,347 --> 00:47:26,610
Phew, what a scare

774
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,915
I'm so nervous, I'm about to leak

775
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:34,052
Tahai man, to protect his territory

776
00:47:34,052 --> 00:47:37,803
urinate on his tree he will

777
00:47:37,803 --> 00:47:40,900
If someone else should urinate on it,
sacrificed they will be

778
00:47:41,456 --> 00:47:45,589
Check the smell you should

779
00:47:49,402 --> 00:47:52,004
Not here

780
00:47:55,566 --> 00:47:58,230
And here!

781
00:47:59,283 --> 00:48:00,674
Saori-san

782
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:13,435
I have to climb here?

783
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:16,931
I leaked a little

784
00:48:29,808 --> 00:48:31,729
I can't hold it in anymore!

785
00:48:44,066 --> 00:48:44,763
I can't stop

786
00:48:44,763 --> 00:48:47,169
The river...  Very important

787
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,272
Beat shit out of you they will
...if you taint it

788
00:49:13,316 --> 00:49:16,008
Hail the virgin!

789
00:49:16,009 --> 00:49:19,009
All hail...  the virgin!

790
00:49:24,554 --> 00:49:25,825
Dance

791
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:28,521
Dance!

792
00:49:28,521 --> 00:49:30,421
You want me to dance?

793
00:50:13,271 --> 00:50:14,784
Matilda-san?

794
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,096
Tsuyoshi, retreating!

795
00:51:02,682 --> 00:51:03,966
Shoot, I left my bag behind

796
00:51:04,931 --> 00:51:06,074
I don't have my map

797
00:51:07,111 --> 00:51:09,082
What am I gonna do?

798
00:51:20,808 --> 00:51:23,011
Help meeeeee

799
00:51:28,536 --> 00:51:30,547
Help me...

800
00:52:21,813 --> 00:52:26,165
I can't do this anymore...

801
00:52:40,436 --> 00:52:42,290
Grandpa...

802
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:44,891
This is a blind date, isn't it

803
00:52:44,891 --> 00:52:45,731
I'm sorry

804
00:52:46,169 --> 00:52:49,269
At this rate, our family...

805
00:52:49,269 --> 00:52:53,388
...and my 3,000 employees
would be left stranded

806
00:52:53,388 --> 00:52:54,337
But...

807
00:52:59,353 --> 00:53:01,300
Are you Ms. Saori Aoyama?

808
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,587
Nice to meet you

809
00:53:02,587 --> 00:53:03,566
I'm Maezono

810
00:53:05,726 --> 00:53:08,583
You weren't up for today's date, were you?

811
00:53:08,583 --> 00:53:10,146
That's not true

812
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:12,759
But for me, it was very good

813
00:53:14,753 --> 00:53:16,898
I've only spoken to you for a few hours

814
00:53:16,898 --> 00:53:19,961
But it hit me

815
00:53:19,961 --> 00:53:22,359
You're the woman I'm destined to be with

816
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:30,485
I'm sorry, I'm currently seeing someone

817
00:53:32,329 --> 00:53:34,040
I know

818
00:53:34,671 --> 00:53:36,075
but

819
00:53:36,891 --> 00:53:39,480
I'm definitely being drawn...

820
00:53:40,627 --> 00:53:41,947
to you

821
00:54:00,777 --> 00:54:02,480
It's the cave!

822
00:54:08,352 --> 00:54:09,653
Saori-san...

823
00:54:10,612 --> 00:54:12,567
led me here!

824
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:40,491
These are

825
00:54:40,491 --> 00:54:44,554
the black pearls of fate!

826
00:54:59,135 --> 00:55:00,379
Mr. Kuroki??

827
00:55:01,403 --> 00:55:02,284
Kuroki?

828
00:55:02,284 --> 00:55:04,047
Kurokki!

829
00:55:04,047 --> 00:55:05,463
Kurokki?

830
00:55:05,587 --> 00:55:08,929
Oh um, I want my black pearl

831
00:55:10,748 --> 00:55:12,472
My name is Tsuyoshi Yamada,
my birthdate is...

832
00:55:12,472 --> 00:55:14,224
Silence!

833
00:55:14,224 --> 00:55:16,174
You don't need to tell me.

834
00:55:16,174 --> 00:55:17,527
Uh, Japanese?

835
00:55:54,516 --> 00:55:56,011
Thank you so much!

836
00:55:56,011 --> 00:55:58,004
No problem

837
00:55:58,529 --> 00:56:01,432
I finally found it...

840
00:56:45,256 --> 00:56:47,373
TuyoTam, I found the black pearl!

841
00:56:50,078 --> 00:56:53,301
Jinkama-san?
What are you doing here?

842
00:56:53,301 --> 00:56:58,049
I got it too...
The black pearl

843
00:56:58,049 --> 00:57:02,367
I never saw one so convoluted

844
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,841
I'm staying here for a while

845
00:57:06,668 --> 00:57:09,228
TsuyoTam is out in the back

846
00:57:13,073 --> 00:57:14,003
Jinkama-san

847
00:57:14,506 --> 00:57:16,201
so cute she is

848
00:57:16,201 --> 00:57:19,125
TuyoTam!
I found the black pearl of fate!

849
00:57:19,125 --> 00:57:21,382
Wow, amazing it is!

850
00:57:21,382 --> 00:57:24,227
What does this say?

851
00:57:26,927 --> 00:57:30,499
22 years old, will be with woman, no no no

852
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:35,468
Afterwards,
meet someone out of his league he will

853
00:57:35,468 --> 00:57:37,606
Help him his many friends do

854
00:57:37,606 --> 00:57:39,627
and his love, realize it will be

855
00:57:40,567 --> 00:57:42,186
but...

856
00:57:42,186 --> 00:57:43,132
What's wrong?

857
00:57:46,009 --> 00:57:47,487
Tell me

858
00:57:49,453 --> 00:57:52,125
Before their one year anniversary

859
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:55,105
While he away from Japan

860
00:57:55,105 --> 00:57:58,731
love of his life, for many reaon

861
00:57:58,731 --> 00:58:00,993
finds another man she will

862
00:58:00,993 --> 00:58:05,244
She then be happy

863
00:58:05,244 --> 00:58:06,916
Another man?

864
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,674
I don't know

865
00:58:08,674 --> 00:58:13,665
But, what's inscribed here always comes true

866
00:58:13,665 --> 00:58:16,004
No...

867
00:58:16,004 --> 00:58:19,374
But then me and Saori-san...

868
00:58:21,439 --> 00:58:22,494
That can't be!

869
00:58:22,494 --> 00:58:26,358
I...  As black pearl said...

870
00:58:26,358 --> 00:58:28,975
woman I loved in the past

871
00:58:28,975 --> 00:58:32,252
left me behind

872
00:58:32,252 --> 00:58:35,009
Us two... our face

873
00:58:35,009 --> 00:58:36,641
our hearts...

874
00:58:36,641 --> 00:58:38,190
very alike

875
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:43,756
So understand your pain I do

876
00:58:49,016 --> 00:58:51,131
Thanks

877
00:59:08,437 --> 00:59:10,769
I might break up with Hermes

878
00:59:10,769 --> 00:59:12,869
What are you talking about?

879
00:59:12,869 --> 00:59:15,294
There really was a black pearl of fate

880
00:59:15,294 --> 00:59:18,381
but on the black pearl given to me by the sage

881
00:59:18,381 --> 00:59:19,968
was inscribed words that foretold the end...

882
00:59:19,968 --> 00:59:22,080
of the relationship I have with Hermes

883
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,488
And on my way back home

884
00:59:23,488 --> 00:59:27,803
something unbelievable happened

885
00:59:32,863 --> 00:59:34,354
Need a lift?

886
00:59:36,516 --> 00:59:39,462
Huh?  A blind date?

887
00:59:39,462 --> 00:59:40,928
Let me get to the point

888
00:59:40,928 --> 00:59:42,723
Give me Saori-san

889
00:59:44,556 --> 00:59:46,620
I can make her happy

890
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:49,369
I can say that with confidence

891
00:59:49,369 --> 00:59:52,645
I can make her happy too

892
00:59:52,327 --> 00:59:56,809
Well, it's difficult for me to say this, but...

893
00:59:56,809 --> 01:00:00,512
her grandfather's company
isn't doing well these days

894
01:00:00,512 --> 01:00:03,147
and needs some help from my company

895
01:00:03,147 --> 01:00:07,158
In other words,
from a financial standpoint as well...

896
01:00:07,158 --> 01:00:10,273
I can protect her and her family

897
01:00:15,158 --> 01:00:16,741
Can you do the same?

898
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,114
I was shocked

899
01:00:20,114 --> 01:00:22,479
Not only that Hermes went on a date

900
01:00:22,479 --> 01:00:26,710
but also that I couldn't protect her and her family

901
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:31,689
The guy really might be able to keep her happy

902
01:00:31,689 --> 01:00:32,769
Snap out of it!

903
01:00:32,769 --> 01:00:34,560
Hermes is only interested in you!

904
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,952
Hermes did it to save her Grandpa's face!

905
01:00:36,952 --> 01:00:37,640
Cut her some slack!

906
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,279
But what's this about Hermes's family
being in dire straits?

907
01:00:40,279 --> 01:00:43,714
That doesn't matter!
Densha's feelings can overcome anything!

908
01:00:43,714 --> 01:00:44,513
Who cares about the black pearl!

909
01:00:44,513 --> 01:00:45,657
Who cares about the blind date?

910
01:00:45,657 --> 01:00:47,029
Let me ask you this

911
01:00:47,029 --> 01:00:49,441
Densha, can you break up with Hermes?

912
01:00:49,441 --> 01:00:51,679
Can you give Hermes to that other guy?

913
01:00:54,498 --> 01:00:56,462
Densha, think carefully

914
01:00:57,336 --> 01:01:01,643
You should know what is best for Hermes

915
01:01:16,665 --> 01:01:17,633
Tsuyoshi

916
01:01:18,037 --> 01:01:19,631
You have a guest

917
01:01:27,473 --> 01:01:29,822
Sir...

918
01:01:29,822 --> 01:01:33,262
Sorry to come by again and again

919
01:01:36,011 --> 01:01:40,851
There was something else to
what I told you the other day

920
01:01:40,851 --> 01:01:42,635
You mean the blind date?

921
01:01:42,635 --> 01:01:43,872
You knew about it?

922
01:01:47,222 --> 01:01:51,238
I know this is a lot to ask of you

923
01:01:52,383 --> 01:01:55,248
But...  I can't take this anymore

924
01:01:56,903 --> 01:02:03,009
It's beyond my control now.

925
01:02:03,009 --> 01:02:05,481
Please

926
01:02:05,481 --> 01:02:07,306
For the sake of Saori and our family

927
01:02:08,241 --> 01:02:13,134
and also our 3,000 employees

928
01:02:13,134 --> 01:02:17,263
please break up with Saori

929
01:02:18,199 --> 01:02:23,242
Please

930
01:02:23,242 --> 01:02:26,313
I beg of you

931
01:02:34,771 --> 01:02:38,556
Before our one year anniversary

932
01:02:38,556 --> 01:02:43,365
The woman I love the most,
due to a variety of circumstances

933
01:02:43,365 --> 01:02:46,680
will be with someone else

934
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:51,989
Financially as well,
I can care for her and her family

935
01:02:51,989 --> 01:02:54,062
For my family...

936
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:56,990
...and 3,000 employees

937
01:02:56,990 --> 01:03:01,212
Would you please break up with Saori?

938
01:03:50,853 --> 01:03:53,474
Saori-san

939
01:04:01,812 --> 01:04:05,720
I broke up with Hermes today

940
01:04:14,072 --> 01:04:15,634
Uh...

941
01:04:17,078 --> 01:04:20,976
W, w, w, w, w, w, w, what are you...

942
01:04:20,976 --> 01:04:24,128
Red alert!  Yamanashi prefecture
8th combat unit communications officer

943
01:04:24,128 --> 01:04:26,789
We're under attack!

944
01:04:26,789 --> 01:04:30,183
G, g, g, g, give me the details!

945
01:04:32,938 --> 01:04:34,806
I'm sorry...

946
01:04:34,806 --> 01:04:37,246
to call you out here all the sudden

947
01:04:37,246 --> 01:04:38,845
It's okay

948
01:04:38,845 --> 01:04:43,760
I wanted to see you and clear up some things

949
01:04:44,228 --> 01:04:46,962
I was going to ask you before

950
01:04:46,962 --> 01:04:50,908
I...

951
01:04:51,273 --> 01:04:52,504
I...

952
01:04:56,769 --> 01:04:57,977
can't...

953
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,713
make...

954
01:05:03,475 --> 01:05:04,761
you happy

955
01:05:13,067 --> 01:05:14,770
Please...

956
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:24,202
break up with me

957
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:31,448
Why?

958
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:37,148
Is it because of Misuzu-san?

959
01:05:39,917 --> 01:05:44,811
Did you go to Tahiti with her too?

960
01:05:52,555 --> 01:05:55,244
I knew in the back of my mind...

961
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:00,724
Our phone calls became very short

962
01:06:01,519 --> 01:06:04,453
and you weren't able to see me

963
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:19,084
I could sense that
your feelings weren't with me

964
01:06:30,687 --> 01:06:32,268
I'm so sorry

965
01:06:36,419 --> 01:06:38,180
That's why

966
01:06:40,861 --> 01:06:45,005
I don't...

967
01:06:45,005 --> 01:06:47,042
I..

968
01:06:47,782 --> 01:06:49,535
I don't...

969
01:06:53,907 --> 01:06:56,652
love...

970
01:06:56,652 --> 01:06:59,008
love you anymore

971
01:07:18,587 --> 01:07:22,122
Being with you...

972
01:07:22,122 --> 01:07:25,426
was what made me happy

973
01:07:41,722 --> 01:07:43,729
Good bye.

974
01:08:13,438 --> 01:08:16,713
Even when you love someone...
There are things beyond your control

975
01:08:18,263 --> 01:08:21,543
If I leave, her family...

976
01:08:21,543 --> 01:08:26,217
and more importantly,
she herself will be happy

977
01:08:26,217 --> 01:08:28,429
This is how it should be

978
01:08:28,429 --> 01:08:30,638
That's bullshit!

979
01:08:30,638 --> 01:08:33,782
How can you say that it's for her good!?

980
01:08:33,782 --> 01:08:36,950
You're only worried about money!

981
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:41,157
Don't betray us because of some money problems!

982
01:08:41,157 --> 01:08:45,843
It's true that my financial weakness
is one reason

983
01:08:46,778 --> 01:08:49,494
I can't protect her

984
01:08:49,494 --> 01:08:52,439
And the other guy can

985
01:08:53,633 --> 01:08:58,575
But...  Our looks and who we are...
I wasn't up to her level

986
01:08:59,162 --> 01:09:02,551
And in any case,
I don't think it would have worked out

987
01:09:02,551 --> 01:09:04,881
What the...
This isn't like you, Densha

988
01:09:04,881 --> 01:09:07,091
You're already talking like you're over her!

989
01:09:07,091 --> 01:09:10,467
Were your feelings for her that weak?

990
01:09:10,467 --> 01:09:10,993
You're despicable!

991
01:09:10,993 --> 01:09:15,625
You stomped on not only our feelings...
but those of Hermes as well!

992
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:19,058
Densha, you're just being a coward

993
01:09:19,058 --> 01:09:21,841
Why don't you try to make Hermes happy on your own?

994
01:09:21,841 --> 01:09:25,786
The Densha we know...
Would have pushed such obstacles aside!

995
01:09:25,786 --> 01:09:29,599
If I think about her life
This is the best choice for her

996
01:09:31,496 --> 01:09:36,952
As long as she's happy,
I'm fine with that

997
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:40,146
Please try to understand

998
01:09:40,146 --> 01:09:41,967
You're only trying to look good

999
01:09:41,967 --> 01:09:43,109
You can still do something about this

1000
01:09:43,109 --> 01:09:45,912
That's unacceptable!

1001
01:09:45,912 --> 01:09:48,087
What the hell happened to you Densha!?

1002
01:09:48,087 --> 01:09:51,335
I want Densha and Hermes to stay together!

1003
01:09:51,335 --> 01:09:53,575
We'll help you out the best we can, too!

1004
01:09:53,575 --> 01:09:55,660
Don't lose to some hotshot president!

1005
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:59,559
You've stood up to so much up until now!

1006
01:09:59,559 --> 01:10:01,635
It's not hopeless!

1007
01:10:01,635 --> 01:10:03,051
Get back with her!

1008
01:10:03,051 --> 01:10:05,973
Densha, you're a hero for otakus like us!

1009
01:10:05,973 --> 01:10:08,305
Hermes is waiting for you, Densha

1010
01:10:08,305 --> 01:10:10,713
If there's anything we can do...
Let us know!

1011
01:10:10,713 --> 01:10:14,292
You overcame so many obstacles

1012
01:10:14,292 --> 01:10:16,771
This time, you can come out strong too!

1013
01:10:22,849 --> 01:10:24,275
It hurts...

1014
01:10:37,904 --> 01:10:39,313
Reading all your posts...

1015
01:10:40,237 --> 01:10:41,849
hurts me so much...

1016
01:10:51,041 --> 01:10:52,844
I'm sorry

1017
01:10:54,592 --> 01:10:56,690
I don't think I can live up to your expectations

1018
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:08,599
Thank you

1019
01:11:08,599 --> 01:11:09,887
Thank you so much

1020
01:11:09,887 --> 01:11:12,936
For all your help

1021
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:14,839
But...

1022
01:11:14,839 --> 01:11:16,046
I...

1023
01:11:16,046 --> 01:11:17,736
I'm finished

1024
01:12:52,038 --> 01:12:54,232
I'm glad I came here

1025
01:12:54,232 --> 01:12:57,856
I suddenly pictured your sad face

1026
01:12:59,929 --> 01:13:01,844
And this...

1027
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:05,783
are you sure?

1028
01:13:05,783 --> 01:13:08,155
With things like this,
someone's gotta take care of it

1029
01:13:08,155 --> 01:13:11,681
I'll safeguard it for now

1030
01:13:11,681 --> 01:13:13,258
Thanks...

1031
01:13:13,258 --> 01:13:14,850
for doing all this

1032
01:13:16,741 --> 01:13:18,146
No worries

1033
01:13:20,370 --> 01:13:22,745
The Miina figure

1034
01:13:22,745 --> 01:13:24,979
The tazer gun

1035
01:13:24,979 --> 01:13:26,778
A pair of chokers

1036
01:13:26,778 --> 01:13:30,039
Dammit, when she gave him this,
they exchanged a grown-up kiss...

1037
01:13:30,039 --> 01:13:33,405
How's my Densha Otoko Museum?

1038
01:13:33,405 --> 01:13:35,861
It's perfect.
I'm arranging all this, after all.

1039
01:13:35,861 --> 01:13:37,301
I'm leaving this to you

1040
01:13:37,301 --> 01:13:41,311
The Densha Otoko Museum is going to get
my foot in the otaku industry's door

1041
01:13:41,311 --> 01:13:42,642
I know!

1042
01:13:42,642 --> 01:13:45,525
This isn't someone else's business for me either!

1043
01:13:45,525 --> 01:13:48,367
I put all your 10 million yen into our stock

1044
01:13:48,367 --> 01:13:51,029
If this works, Cyber Next's
brand recognition will shoot straight up

1045
01:13:51,029 --> 01:13:53,164
And the stock price will go up 100 fold,
no, 200 fold!

1046
01:13:53,164 --> 01:13:55,840
I can finally kiss my pennysaving days goodbye!

1047
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,223
Now witness the miraculous comeback performance of Kazuya Sakurai!

1048
01:13:58,223 --> 01:13:59,539
...and you're already gone

1049
01:14:01,516 --> 01:14:04,265
Are you really okay with this?

1050
01:14:04,265 --> 01:14:08,371
Yes.  Maezono-san seems like a kind person

1051
01:14:10,346 --> 01:14:15,964
He kind of reminds me of your father

1052
01:14:15,964 --> 01:14:18,696
He's kind of cold-hearted...

1053
01:14:18,696 --> 01:14:21,735
and I can't really tell what he's thinking

1054
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:25,006
Is Yamada-san really all that bad?

1055
01:14:26,693 --> 01:14:28,138
It's fine

1056
01:14:28,138 --> 01:14:34,451
This way,
grandpa's business can get back on track

1057
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:43,610
I...

1058
01:14:43,610 --> 01:14:47,128
I don't care if I live in a studio apartment

1059
01:14:47,782 --> 01:14:50,513
Mother...

1060
01:14:59,762 --> 01:15:02,029
I died again

1061
01:15:02,029 --> 01:15:04,596
Tsuyoshi!
You have a guest

1062
01:15:07,115 --> 01:15:08,759
Jinkama-san

1063
01:15:08,759 --> 01:15:11,728
You've been pretty busy, haven't you

1064
01:15:11,728 --> 01:15:14,048
You have Saori-san, and yet...

1065
01:15:14,048 --> 01:15:17,034
But when I was young,
I met many young girls and...

1066
01:15:17,034 --> 01:15:19,390
You fucking talk way too much, old man!

1067
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:25,169
Weren't you in Tahiti?

1068
01:15:25,169 --> 01:15:27,629
I got tired of Mr. Black Pearl

1069
01:15:27,629 --> 01:15:31,806
I heard rumors of a really great man
in South America

1070
01:15:31,806 --> 01:15:32,561
Is that so?

1071
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:35,425
What's with the long face?

1072
01:15:37,688 --> 01:15:39,300
I broke up with Saori-san

1073
01:15:42,949 --> 01:15:45,151
It's just as the black pearl foretold

1074
01:15:45,151 --> 01:15:47,812
To protect her grandfather's company,
Saori-san...

1075
01:15:47,812 --> 01:15:50,174
went out with her grandfather's client!

1076
01:15:50,174 --> 01:15:52,075
That's not what it's foretelling

1077
01:15:56,003 --> 01:15:58,357
This is your real black pearl

1078
01:16:00,741 --> 01:16:02,149
What do you mean?

1079
01:16:02,149 --> 01:16:03,340
It was all a ploy

1080
01:16:06,318 --> 01:16:07,634
When TuyoTam read your black pearl...

1081
01:16:07,634 --> 01:16:10,359
he thought it was strange...

1082
01:16:10,359 --> 01:16:14,662
that the fortune was cut off in the middle

1083
01:16:14,662 --> 01:16:16,544
When we confronted the Sage about this

1084
01:16:16,544 --> 01:16:22,093
He told us that a Japanese man bribed him
into giving you a fake black pearl

1085
01:16:22,706 --> 01:16:24,633
Who would...

1086
01:16:24,633 --> 01:16:27,010
Some creep named Maezono

1087
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:29,732
He did it to cause a rift between you two

1088
01:16:29,732 --> 01:16:31,094
Maezono-san did?

1089
01:16:31,804 --> 01:16:33,350
What are you gonna do?

1090
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:34,958
What do you mean?

1091
01:16:34,958 --> 01:16:38,104
You pulled back because
you wanted her to be happy, right?

1092
01:16:38,104 --> 01:16:41,070
You think she can be happy with Maezono?

1093
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:55,456
Sheesh...

1094
01:17:03,013 --> 01:17:04,781
Tsuyoshi Yamada is here to see you

1095
01:17:04,781 --> 01:17:05,763
Let him in

1096
01:17:10,296 --> 01:17:12,235
It's about time you came here

1097
01:17:13,229 --> 01:17:14,571
You tricked me

1098
01:17:14,571 --> 01:17:16,629
Giving me a fake black pearl...

1099
01:17:16,629 --> 01:17:18,236
Look who's talking

1100
01:17:18,236 --> 01:17:21,860
It's your fault for believing something like that and breaking up with her

1101
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:23,823
Densha Otoko

1102
01:17:23,823 --> 01:17:24,842
How do you...

1103
01:17:25,578 --> 01:17:26,771
You still don't know?

1104
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:31,131
Cyber Next...

1105
01:17:31,131 --> 01:17:32,867
Indeed!

1106
01:17:32,867 --> 01:17:35,193
The brains behind
"The Hunt for Densha Otoko"

1107
01:17:35,193 --> 01:17:37,234
Also, the one who put her grandpa's company
on the line in exchange for her hand

1108
01:17:37,234 --> 01:17:39,549
is also me.

1109
01:17:39,549 --> 01:17:40,989
How could you...

1110
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:42,790
Of course

1111
01:17:42,790 --> 01:17:44,952
to take Hermes

1112
01:17:44,952 --> 01:17:47,744
She's a mighty fine woman

1113
01:17:47,744 --> 01:17:50,114
She knows it's a political marriage,
but for her grandfather's company

1114
01:17:50,114 --> 01:17:52,670
she'll sacrifice herself

1115
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:57,668
Well, you can't save the Aoyama family

1116
01:17:57,668 --> 01:17:59,253
So then

1117
01:17:59,798 --> 01:18:00,959
I'll give you a chance

1118
01:18:07,075 --> 01:18:08,805
Cyber Next
Densha Otoko Museum

1119
01:18:08,805 --> 01:18:11,377
Cyber Next presents:

1120
01:18:11,377 --> 01:18:13,459
Densha Otoko Museum?

1121
01:18:13,459 --> 01:18:14,073
Exactly

1122
01:18:14,073 --> 01:18:18,332
If you go up on stage tomorrow and tell everyone you're Densha Otoko

1123
01:18:18,332 --> 01:18:20,394
I'll release her from her obligations

1124
01:18:20,394 --> 01:18:24,660
Of course,
I'll invest in her grandfather's company

1125
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:25,778
What do you think?

1126
01:18:29,438 --> 01:18:31,768
It's up to you to come or not

1127
01:18:41,811 --> 01:18:43,718
Tomorrow is opening day

1128
01:18:43,718 --> 01:18:46,027
We haven't started but the stock price is already shooting up

1129
01:18:46,027 --> 01:18:47,446
Densha Otoko is taking center stage

1130
01:18:47,446 --> 01:18:48,867
Everyone will be talking about it

1131
01:18:49,238 --> 01:18:50,300
Densha is?

1132
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:51,319
He's really coming here?

1133
01:18:51,319 --> 01:18:52,363
He'll come by for sure.

1134
01:18:52,363 --> 01:18:54,661
Why are you so confident?

1135
01:18:54,661 --> 01:18:57,882
I told him that
I won't marry Hermes if he comes on stage

1136
01:18:57,882 --> 01:18:59,234
You're giving up on Hermes?

1137
01:19:00,464 --> 01:19:03,814
If he goes up on stage,
he'll be at the center of media attention

1138
01:19:03,814 --> 01:19:06,668
If so, the person
who'll be most troubled is Hermes

1139
01:19:08,416 --> 01:19:10,429
He understands this

1140
01:19:10,429 --> 01:19:16,553
So even if he exposes himself,
he won't get back with Hermes

1141
01:19:16,553 --> 01:19:19,108
So either way,
Densha won't be with Hermes

1142
01:19:20,783 --> 01:19:22,914
In this world...

1143
01:19:22,914 --> 01:19:25,308
true love never becomes realized

1144
01:19:33,383 --> 01:19:38,654
Densha Otoko, if you expose your identity,
I'll let go of Hermes

1145
01:19:56,721 --> 01:19:59,070
It's so hard to get tickets!

1146
01:20:00,256 --> 01:20:02,235
Mr. Kawamoto!
The phone!

1147
01:20:02,235 --> 01:20:07,684
What are you breaking my phone for?

1148
01:20:07,684 --> 01:20:08,979
What are you doing?

1149
01:20:10,233 --> 01:20:13,783
Apparently at the Densha Otoko museum,
his true identity will be revealed!

1150
01:20:14,281 --> 01:20:17,997
What do you mean his identity?
You know who he is already

1151
01:20:17,997 --> 01:20:20,189
Yuko, what do you mean?

1152
01:20:20,189 --> 01:20:25,032
Since Densha Otoko is Tsuyoshi Yamada,
there's no point in us going to see!

1153
01:20:37,928 --> 01:20:38,612
Hello?

1154
01:20:38,612 --> 01:20:39,771
Mr. Yamada!

1155
01:20:39,771 --> 01:20:41,902
Yuko told us everything

1156
01:20:41,902 --> 01:20:44,424
To think that you were Densha Otoko...

1157
01:20:46,647 --> 01:20:48,049
I'm sorry I hid that from you

1158
01:20:48,908 --> 01:20:52,973
Are you going to show yourself to the public?

1159
01:20:52,973 --> 01:20:55,000
Yes

1160
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,338
Why?

1161
01:20:57,338 --> 01:21:01,106
It's the condition for him to not marry Hermes

1162
01:21:01,106 --> 01:21:04,721
But I thought you left Hermes on your own

1163
01:21:04,721 --> 01:21:07,440
It was all a scheme

1164
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:14,525
This is the only way...
to save Saori-san and the Aoyamas

1165
01:21:14,525 --> 01:21:16,255
I'm sorry

1166
01:21:16,647 --> 01:21:17,792
Mr. Yamada?

1167
01:21:17,792 --> 01:21:20,135
Mr. Yamada!

1168
01:21:20,816 --> 01:21:22,141
He turned off his phone!

1169
01:21:22,141 --> 01:21:23,100
What are you gonna do?

1170
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:25,198
If Mr. Yamada comes out as Densha Otoko

1171
01:21:25,198 --> 01:21:28,887
The media is gonna get him,
and he'll be ruined!

1172
01:21:28,887 --> 01:21:30,498
We have to stop him somehow

1173
01:21:30,498 --> 01:21:32,186
...hey what do you think you're doing?

1174
01:21:35,601 --> 01:21:36,512
I see it!

1175
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:38,687
So you were in deep contemplation

1176
01:21:39,238 --> 01:21:40,424
Long time no see

1177
01:21:40,424 --> 01:21:41,471
This is Guitar Otoko

1178
01:21:42,411 --> 01:21:45,217
Guitar Otoko?

1179
01:21:45,217 --> 01:21:47,876
I found some information about Densha

1180
01:21:48,828 --> 01:21:52,127
As a condition for Hermes to be let free

1181
01:21:52,127 --> 01:21:54,151
he's exposing his identity at
the Densha Otoko museum!

1182
01:21:54,151 --> 01:21:55,576
You're kidding...

1183
01:21:55,576 --> 01:21:59,114
So it was in Maezono's plans to have
Densha break up with Hermes!

1184
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:01,695
It was all going as Maezono planned!

1185
01:22:01,695 --> 01:22:04,624
Is Densha going to expose himself
for Hermes's sake?

1186
01:22:04,624 --> 01:22:07,850
If he shows himself,
the Densha haters will ruin him!

1187
01:22:07,850 --> 01:22:09,696
Densha...  Come back!

1188
01:22:09,696 --> 01:22:12,417
But the probability of him reading this...
Is 0%!

1189
01:22:12,417 --> 01:22:15,275
So long as he isn't reading this thread,
there's nothing we can do

1190
01:22:15,275 --> 01:22:18,702
But if he decided this without
talking to us first...

1191
01:22:18,702 --> 01:22:21,168
does that mean he doesn't need us anymore?

1192
01:22:25,371 --> 01:22:28,581
It was like this when he broke up with her, too

1193
01:22:28,581 --> 01:22:31,701
Densha is already somewhere way beyond us

1194
01:22:31,701 --> 01:22:34,170
He can go on his own without our help

1195
01:22:34,170 --> 01:22:35,943
It's kinda lonely...

1196
01:22:40,741 --> 01:22:42,030
But...

1197
01:22:42,030 --> 01:22:44,301
The one most lonely...

1198
01:22:44,301 --> 01:22:46,238
is Densha, isn't it?

1199
01:22:47,691 --> 01:22:50,441
Yes...

1200
01:22:50,441 --> 01:22:52,053
You're right

1201
01:22:54,701 --> 01:22:55,949
Everyone

1202
01:22:55,949 --> 01:22:57,521
listen up

1203
01:22:57,521 --> 01:23:01,982
A part of me thought that
Densha doesn't need us anymore

1204
01:23:01,982 --> 01:23:04,696
But...
Densha and us...

1205
01:23:04,696 --> 01:23:06,554
None of us are strong people

1206
01:23:07,521 --> 01:23:11,408
That's why we all help each other out, right?

1207
01:23:11,408 --> 01:23:16,524
You guys...
Can we let Densha go to battle alone?

1208
01:23:24,595 --> 01:23:25,895
You're right

1209
01:23:25,895 --> 01:23:29,257
If we don't help Densha in his time of need,
who will?

1210
01:23:29,257 --> 01:23:31,536
He's ready to give up everything

1211
01:23:31,536 --> 01:23:33,870
Isn't this the time to give back to Densha
what he gave to all of us?

1212
01:23:33,870 --> 01:23:36,249
Don't fall victim to
Cyber Next!

1213
01:23:36,249 --> 01:23:38,667
I won't let people making fun of Akihabara
walk all over me!

1214
01:23:38,667 --> 01:23:40,076
But what should we do?

1215
01:23:40,076 --> 01:23:42,324
Chief, you have a plan, right?

1216
01:23:42,324 --> 01:23:43,912
Of course

1217
01:23:43,912 --> 01:23:47,549
There's only one thing we can do

1218
01:24:01,730 --> 01:24:06,455
Cyber Next
Densha Otoko Museum

1219
01:24:21,959 --> 01:24:24,519
Sorry to come by all the sudden

1220
01:24:24,519 --> 01:24:27,349
It's okay

1221
01:24:27,349 --> 01:24:30,158
Here's Yamada's black pearl of fate

1222
01:24:31,505 --> 01:24:33,494
I forgot to give this to him

1223
01:24:33,494 --> 01:24:35,012
...so I thought if you could

1224
01:24:38,498 --> 01:24:39,989
Yamada, he...

1225
01:24:39,989 --> 01:24:42,640
went out of his way to find that for you

1226
01:24:44,106 --> 01:24:47,655
but...  He...

1227
01:24:47,655 --> 01:24:49,801
I thought he was into you...

1228
01:24:52,107 --> 01:24:54,353
No way!

1229
01:24:54,353 --> 01:24:57,964
If I was misleading you I'll apologize

1230
01:24:57,964 --> 01:25:04,156
but Yamada doesn't even look at other women

1231
01:25:04,156 --> 01:25:10,107
And that Maezono guy...
He has his feet deep in some shady business

1232
01:26:03,113 --> 01:26:06,164
Take her to dinner in return for the cup

1233
01:26:18,744 --> 01:26:23,990
Hermes's famous sayings

1234
01:26:23,990 --> 01:26:27,243
I'm not letting go

1235
01:26:27,243 --> 01:26:29,176
It's okay

1236
01:26:30,567 --> 01:26:32,354
I'm not letting go

1237
01:26:38,913 --> 01:26:42,333
Densha Otoko!
Read the message board!

1238
01:26:43,507 --> 01:26:46,693
Densha!
Confess to her!

1239
01:26:48,393 --> 01:26:50,260
I...

1240
01:26:50,260 --> 01:26:56,330
Aoyama-san...

1241
01:26:56,330 --> 01:26:58,098
I like you so much!

1242
01:27:28,416 --> 01:27:30,765
Densha Otoko
Museum

1243
01:27:35,089 --> 01:27:36,592
You want to call off the engagement?

1244
01:27:36,592 --> 01:27:39,452
My grandfather told me everything

1245
01:27:39,452 --> 01:27:41,618
about you, too

1246
01:27:43,371 --> 01:27:45,499
What a fool

1247
01:27:45,882 --> 01:27:50,298
But it looks like you found out too late

1248
01:27:55,956 --> 01:27:58,536
Thank you for attending
"Cyber Next Presents:"

1249
01:27:58,536 --> 01:28:01,140
"Densha Otoko Museum"

1250
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:04,039
Thank you very, very much

1251
01:28:04,039 --> 01:28:05,468
And now

1252
01:28:05,468 --> 01:28:09,343
The true identity of Densha Otoko
will be revealed on the special stage

1253
01:28:09,343 --> 01:28:12,949
Everyone please look forward to it!

1254
01:28:17,103 --> 01:28:18,895
Don't hate me, Densha

1255
01:28:21,063 --> 01:28:22,867
Cyber Next stock is up again!

1256
01:28:25,519 --> 01:28:27,064
Why...

1257
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:30,926
Densha Otoko is a good source of money

1258
01:28:33,307 --> 01:28:37,035
It's hard to come across a love story
so pure and emotional

1259
01:28:37,861 --> 01:28:40,537
The more you wave this in front of people

1260
01:28:40,537 --> 01:28:43,526
foolish people will twist this into
an ugly love story

1261
01:28:44,292 --> 01:28:46,472
So I...

1262
01:28:46,472 --> 01:28:49,081
will put an end to this story

1263
01:28:49,081 --> 01:28:51,992
For business purposes only

1264
01:28:55,455 --> 01:28:58,273
And the door is locked, by the way

1265
01:29:01,931 --> 01:29:04,462
It's showtime!

1266
01:29:27,138 --> 01:29:31,207
Momentarily,
Densha Otoko's identity will be revealed

1267
01:29:31,207 --> 01:29:35,670
We ask that our guests please head over
to the special auditorium

1268
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:40,019
I'm sorry

1269
01:29:40,019 --> 01:29:42,852
but I can't let you pass here

1270
01:29:42,852 --> 01:29:44,185
This road has been sealed off!

1271
01:29:44,185 --> 01:29:45,889
I won't let you pass!

1272
01:29:45,889 --> 01:29:48,987
I bet those guys
are fighting for Densha right now

1273
01:29:48,987 --> 01:29:51,837
Fight for my sake too!

1274
01:29:52,268 --> 01:29:52,858
Move out!

1275
01:29:52,858 --> 01:29:53,607
Wait wait

1276
01:29:53,607 --> 01:29:55,783
No, stop!

1277
01:29:56,495 --> 01:29:57,296
Hey!

1278
01:29:57,296 --> 01:29:58,530
Hey, get whoever's in charge over here

1279
01:30:01,382 --> 01:30:03,010
Please don't pass the white line!

1280
01:30:03,010 --> 01:30:04,880
Densha won't be here!

1281
01:30:06,945 --> 01:30:07,837
Shit!

1282
01:30:07,837 --> 01:30:10,519
I should have worked out more!

1283
01:30:10,519 --> 01:30:12,839
It's okay as long as nobody comes in!

1284
01:30:12,839 --> 01:30:14,998
Please don't pull on my hair

1285
01:30:14,998 --> 01:30:18,048
Not letting anyone in even when
Densha walks up to the stage...

1286
01:30:18,048 --> 01:30:19,027
is that really possible?

1287
01:30:19,027 --> 01:30:21,528
We know that's impossible...
But please make it work!

1288
01:30:31,938 --> 01:30:34,787
Please don't push!

1289
01:30:42,946 --> 01:30:44,792
Today's show has been cancelled!

1290
01:30:46,829 --> 01:30:48,784
What the fuck are you guys doing?

1291
01:30:51,849 --> 01:30:54,746
What's going on here!?

1292
01:31:02,326 --> 01:31:03,010
Densha!

1293
01:31:03,010 --> 01:31:04,810
Sit down!

1294
01:31:04,810 --> 01:31:05,691
Let me go!

1295
01:31:13,931 --> 01:31:15,745
Hey, when is this show starting?

1296
01:31:16,553 --> 01:31:18,397
Hurry up and show him to us!

1297
01:31:18,397 --> 01:31:19,816
How long are you gonna make us wait!?

1298
01:31:26,735 --> 01:31:28,013
We've been awaiting you

1299
01:31:28,013 --> 01:31:29,694
Come this way

1300
01:31:35,729 --> 01:31:38,334
Densha Otoko
Museum
In a few moments!

1301
01:31:50,998 --> 01:31:52,139
I hacked into the system

1302
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:53,208
And you?

1303
01:31:53,208 --> 01:31:54,306
Almost there

1304
01:31:55,009 --> 01:31:56,200
Open up!

1305
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:58,020
Get out of there!

1306
01:32:06,307 --> 01:32:07,087
You're...

1307
01:32:07,087 --> 01:32:09,215
Hey!
Long time no see!

1308
01:32:15,046 --> 01:32:16,281
What the hell?

1309
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:17,730
Please make them stop!

1310
01:32:17,730 --> 01:32:19,502
I beg of you

1311
01:32:19,502 --> 01:32:21,021
Oh, it's too late now

1312
01:32:21,951 --> 01:32:24,040
Huh?
What's wrong?

1313
01:32:34,672 --> 01:32:36,152
Thread for single guys to talk shit

1314
01:32:36,152 --> 01:32:40,275
Hey, our thread is showing on the curtain!

1315
01:32:51,069 --> 01:32:52,398
It worked

1316
01:32:57,866 --> 01:33:03,279
Densha,
we're at the entrance to the special auditorium

1317
01:33:03,279 --> 01:33:05,220
We're posting from our cell phones

1318
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:09,818
Our plan failed,
but everyone can see what we're saying

1319
01:33:09,818 --> 01:33:11,161
Post up, everyone

1320
01:33:11,161 --> 01:33:13,522
This is being fed to the auditorium?

1321
01:33:13,522 --> 01:33:15,176
Is Densha reading this too?

1322
01:33:16,823 --> 01:33:17,932
Densha

1323
01:33:17,932 --> 01:33:20,225
Your buddies came to the auditorium
just for you

1324
01:33:20,225 --> 01:33:24,078
We wanted to make it so
nobody would be here when you came

1325
01:33:24,078 --> 01:33:25,675
We're sorry, Densha!

1326
01:33:25,675 --> 01:33:27,711
We all wanted to protect you

1327
01:33:27,711 --> 01:33:29,609
but I guess we're just otakus, after all

1328
01:33:29,609 --> 01:33:31,107
We couldn't do anything

1329
01:33:31,107 --> 01:33:32,763
We know your situation

1330
01:33:32,763 --> 01:33:35,193
It's for Hermes, right?

1331
01:33:37,208 --> 01:33:41,968
Do we have no choice but to chew our
fingernails and watch you embarass yourself?

1332
01:33:41,968 --> 01:33:44,264
I hate myself for being so powerless

1333
01:33:44,264 --> 01:33:47,206
Please everyone
Go home!

1334
01:33:47,206 --> 01:33:50,013
Guys, just because you see who he is...
What's that gonna do

1335
01:33:50,013 --> 01:33:51,674
He's just an otaku

1336
01:33:51,674 --> 01:33:53,533
You'll only be disappointed if you see him

1337
01:33:53,533 --> 01:33:56,575
It's useless to say anything to these people...

1338
01:33:56,575 --> 01:33:58,023
who are poking fun at Akihabara

1339
01:33:58,023 --> 01:34:03,654
I just hope that people are considerate
and won't look at him when appears

1340
01:34:03,654 --> 01:34:06,621
Why does Densha have to deal with this?

1341
01:34:06,621 --> 01:34:09,337
He just wants to be with the one he loves

1342
01:34:09,337 --> 01:34:11,886
Their relationship will be ruined

1343
01:34:11,886 --> 01:34:16,922
Leave him alone if you really care about him

1344
01:34:21,724 --> 01:34:23,810
I'll go up there instead of Tsuyoshi-san

1345
01:34:23,810 --> 01:34:25,108
What are you doing?
Stop them!

1346
01:34:29,067 --> 01:34:32,146
I won't forgive anyone who pokes fun at Densha

1347
01:34:32,146 --> 01:34:35,638
I'll beat the shit out of anyone who stares at Densha

1348
01:34:35,638 --> 01:34:37,841
I know I can't say the same

1349
01:34:37,841 --> 01:34:40,261
but I can't think of anything else to say

1350
01:34:41,133 --> 01:34:44,542
Densha, we know how you feel,
but please go away!

1351
01:34:44,542 --> 01:34:47,728
Please don't show yourself to us

1352
01:34:47,728 --> 01:34:49,662
To be honest, I want to see

1353
01:34:49,662 --> 01:34:50,736
...but I won't!

1354
01:34:50,736 --> 01:34:54,422
If everyone sees,
those two won't be able to stay together

1355
01:34:54,422 --> 01:34:56,541
I'm sorry

1356
01:34:56,541 --> 01:34:58,714
We're all so powerless to help

1357
01:35:01,981 --> 01:35:03,086
Everyone...

1358
01:35:03,086 --> 01:35:06,740
I hate the person who's making money
off of our feelings!

1359
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:08,510
Hey everyone watching this...

1360
01:35:08,510 --> 01:35:10,982
you're just doing as he wants!

1361
01:35:10,982 --> 01:35:14,732
It doesn't matter what Densha looks like
or how he lives

1362
01:35:14,732 --> 01:35:18,287
We all saw how strongly he felt about Hermes

1363
01:35:18,287 --> 01:35:19,813
and we cheered him on

1364
01:35:19,813 --> 01:35:22,688
Please don't shut off our hopes and dreams!

1365
01:35:23,238 --> 01:35:25,053
The legend isn't over yet!

1366
01:35:25,053 --> 01:35:27,761
We want to see this story until the very end!

1367
01:35:27,761 --> 01:35:29,968
It won't be Densha who gets up on stage...

1368
01:35:29,968 --> 01:35:31,034
It'll be me!

1369
01:35:31,034 --> 01:35:34,041
In that case, we can all go up there!

1370
01:35:34,041 --> 01:35:35,518
Shit

1371
01:35:35,518 --> 01:35:37,462
I'll hang on to the curtain

1372
01:35:37,462 --> 01:35:39,383
if it'll keep Densha's identity a secret!

1373
01:35:39,383 --> 01:35:40,862
Everyone at the auditorium

1374
01:35:40,862 --> 01:35:42,337
Let's all get up on stage!

1375
01:35:42,337 --> 01:35:44,302
That way,
they won't know who Densha really is!

1376
01:35:55,252 --> 01:35:56,670
You guys!

1377
01:35:57,470 --> 01:35:59,650
Densha isn't some freak show!

1378
01:36:07,466 --> 01:36:13,517
Do you guys have the right
to steal Densha's happiness away?

1379
01:36:13,517 --> 01:36:18,832
Just let Densha and Hermes have
a normal relationship!

1380
01:36:18,832 --> 01:36:24,677
You don't feel sorry for Densha?

1381
01:36:35,288 --> 01:36:40,037
Thanks to Densha,
I was able to take a step forward

1382
01:36:40,037 --> 01:36:44,228
I'm sure everyone here
also got something from him

1383
01:36:44,228 --> 01:36:49,166
He's risking everything for Hermes
by standing up on stage

1384
01:36:49,166 --> 01:36:51,327
How can you stand by and not help him?

1385
01:36:52,577 --> 01:36:55,210
Is there nothing we can do?

1386
01:36:56,685 --> 01:37:01,523
I believe in the miracle...
that everyone will bring!

1387
01:37:21,575 --> 01:37:28,550
That's what the world calls love!
(Title of the end theme song)

1388
01:37:56,512 --> 01:37:57,815
You guys...

1389
01:37:59,784 --> 01:38:00,979
Thanks...

1390
01:38:02,923 --> 01:38:04,093
Hurry up and raise the curtain!

1391
01:38:04,093 --> 01:38:06,149
You want to turn your stocks
into pieces of paper?

1392
01:38:06,149 --> 01:38:08,326
Open it!

1393
01:38:08,326 --> 01:38:09,340
Open it!!

1394
01:38:14,265 --> 01:38:15,945
If you reveal yourself

1395
01:38:15,945 --> 01:38:17,285
do you have any idea
what'll happen to you?

1396
01:38:19,766 --> 01:38:21,116
I do.

1397
01:38:22,897 --> 01:38:25,988
I won't be able to...

1398
01:38:25,988 --> 01:38:27,421
see

1399
01:38:27,421 --> 01:38:28,739
Saori-san anymore

1400
01:38:29,418 --> 01:38:31,674
You...

1401
01:38:31,674 --> 01:38:33,326
You know full well what'll happen...

1402
01:38:38,898 --> 01:38:40,450
This is...

1403
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,581
to protect Saori-san

1404
01:38:58,895 --> 01:39:00,359
What a show-off

1405
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:06,191
Hey...  What the fuck are you guys doing?

1406
01:39:06,191 --> 01:39:07,725
Hurry up and start it!

1407
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:43,746
Raise the curtain now!

1408
01:39:43,746 --> 01:39:44,797
Yes

1409
01:41:26,544 --> 01:41:27,831
What's going on here?

1410
01:41:37,332 --> 01:41:38,809
They did it...

1411
01:41:50,090 --> 01:41:57,477
Densha Otoko and Hermes-san...
We wish you the best

1412
01:41:58,111 --> 01:42:01,797
We're all rooting for you two

1413
01:42:02,819 --> 01:42:06,824
I want to see Densha
but I won't for their sake

1414
01:42:08,292 --> 01:42:11,303
No matter who Densha really is,
he's still my hero

1415
01:42:13,112 --> 01:42:16,925
Their love story still has
a long way to go, right?

1416
01:42:19,335 --> 01:42:22,160
Stay happy forever

1417
01:42:28,222 --> 01:42:31,922
I'll find a love like Densha did!

1418
01:42:44,419 --> 01:42:46,000
Thank you...

1419
01:42:48,621 --> 01:42:50,855
So this is the power of Densha Otoko

1420
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:56,128
No wonder I can't have you

1421
01:43:01,614 --> 01:43:10,779
I think I know why...
you're so into Densha Otoko

1422
01:43:17,861 --> 01:43:19,710
I lose

1423
01:43:42,243 --> 01:43:43,284
Thank goodness

1424
01:43:45,485 --> 01:43:47,356
Thank you so much

1425
01:43:47,356 --> 01:43:48,796
You're welcome

1426
01:43:49,402 --> 01:43:50,437
And Maezono-san...?

1427
01:43:52,831 --> 01:43:55,112
He left

1428
01:43:55,112 --> 01:43:56,606
He said he was sorry

1429
01:43:57,637 --> 01:44:00,518
I see

1430
01:44:00,518 --> 01:44:02,695
I saw everything

1431
01:44:05,461 --> 01:44:06,634
It made me so happy

1432
01:44:11,372 --> 01:44:14,985
Everyone pushed my back

1433
01:44:17,978 --> 01:44:19,654
I'll always have

1434
01:44:19,654 --> 01:44:21,387
their friendship

1435
01:44:22,893 --> 01:44:24,812
I feel very confident now

1436
01:44:30,935 --> 01:44:31,970
That's...

1437
01:44:35,267 --> 01:44:38,317
This is your black pearl of fate

1438
01:44:45,179 --> 01:44:47,136
Unfortunately it's in Tahitian

1439
01:44:47,939 --> 01:44:50,303
So I can't read our future

1440
01:44:50,303 --> 01:44:51,679
No

1441
01:44:52,728 --> 01:44:54,772
I know what it says

1442
01:45:00,192 --> 01:45:01,327
Um...

1443
01:45:01,997 --> 01:45:04,135
I have something important to say

1444
01:45:09,611 --> 01:45:10,547
Will you...

1445
01:45:16,446 --> 01:45:17,237
M...

1446
01:45:20,914 --> 01:45:27,915
Thanks to the Chinese softsubs,
this took me 'only' 6 hours

1447
01:45:27,915 --> 01:45:34,437
Happy birthday Binkley
I wouldn't have worked for free otherwise

1448
01:45:34,437 --> 01:45:35,003
Everything but timing done by:
Masakun

1449
01:45:35,003 --> 01:45:38,111
Next...  Peru
Everything but timing done by:
Masakun

1450
01:45:38,111 --> 01:45:39,564
I love the sound

Miho Shiraishi = the hotness!
Masakun = the awesomeness!

1454
01:45:48,688 --> 01:45:51,266
You win, Densha
If you read these subs and enjoyed them,

I need to change, too

1457
01:45:55,782 --> 01:45:57,002
This is the last time I'm doing this...
Grad student at UCSD = no time

1458
01:45:57,002 --> 01:45:58,366
Shit, it's him again!
This is the last time I'm doing this...
Grad student at UCSD = no time

1459
01:45:58,366 --> 01:45:59,597
My car!
This is the last time I'm doing this...
Grad student at UCSD = no time

1460
01:45:59,597 --> 01:46:02,778
I'm eternally grateful for
many, many things

1461
01:46:02,778 --> 01:46:02,915
Especially my parents, my healthy body,
my friends, and also...

1462
01:46:02,915 --> 01:46:05,181
Cyber Next's stock price plummeted
Especially my parents, my healthy body,
my friends, and also...

1463
01:46:05,181 --> 01:46:08,187
No!
the internet, which lets me download
shows like this and watch them

1464
01:46:08,187 --> 01:46:11,127
My 10 million in stock!
the internet, which lets me download
shows like this and watch them

1465
01:46:11,127 --> 01:46:12,133
Wait!
the internet, which lets me download
shows like this and watch them

1466
01:46:12,133 --> 01:46:13,238
All I have left is that...
I'm pretty sure this is the last time
Fuji TV is making anything Densha related

1467
01:46:13,238 --> 01:46:15,671
My car, my life...
I'm pretty sure this is the last time
