1
00:00:08,621 --> 00:00:10,429
P...  Please read the message board!

2
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:13,514
I...  I've put all of myself into it.

3
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,294
Pl...  Please!

4
00:00:15,294 --> 00:00:17,135
Please read it until the very end.

5
00:00:17,135 --> 00:00:20,965
At the end, I have a message for you...

6
00:00:44,413 --> 00:00:47,546
After going to an event in Akiba today...

7
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:52,110
there was a drunk on the train who was harassing everyone.

8
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,600
I had to do something about it...

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,192
so I summed up some courage...

10
00:00:55,192 --> 00:00:56,330
and yelled at him...  a little.

11
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,585
Stop it.

12
00:01:03,367 --> 00:01:06,016
S...  I...  I said stop it...

13
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:08,807
My voice was probably shaking.

14
00:01:08,807 --> 00:01:11,331
I never fought with anyone before...

15
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:17,148
Are you okay?

16
00:01:17,148 --> 00:01:20,747
Man, I looked really lame.

17
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:28,296
Oh...oh...oh...oh shoot!

18
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,647
Th..th...the young lady sent me

19
00:01:30,647 --> 00:01:32,713
a thank you package...

20
00:01:32,713 --> 00:01:34,234
along with a letter!

21
00:01:34,234 --> 00:01:35,365
Can you tell from the writing

22
00:01:35,365 --> 00:01:36,740
if it looks like you even...

23
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,311
have a chance with her?

24
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:39,566
Your courage

25
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,190
moved me very much.

26
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,224
Well, that's what it says...

27
00:01:42,224 --> 00:01:43,418
Isn't this too good to be true?

28
00:01:43,418 --> 00:01:45,848
And he's going crazy.

29
00:01:45,848 --> 00:01:47,235
Everyone, don't take this guy seriously.

30
00:01:47,235 --> 00:01:49,947
The...the...the shipping receipt has her cell number!

31
00:01:49,947 --> 00:01:51,678
Call   her   up!

32
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,009
I can't I can't I can't I can't

33
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,074
Just pick up your cell.

34
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:56,995
I have the phone in my hand...

35
00:01:56,995 --> 00:01:58,590
but I can't dial the number!

36
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,139
This is taking more than the time on the train!

37
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:02,290
My hands are getting all sticky

38
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,389
My face is getting warm

39
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:05,117
My heart is doing jumping jacks...

40
00:02:05,117 --> 00:02:07,045
Damn, now -I'm- getting worked up.

41
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:07,947
Don't be fooled.

42
00:02:07,947 --> 00:02:08,957
This has to be some kind of dumb joke!

43
00:02:08,957 --> 00:02:10,544
Let me say just one thing.

44
00:02:10,544 --> 00:02:12,600
The lady on the other end is alone

45
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,192
but you have everyone supporting you.

46
00:02:15,192 --> 00:02:16,211
Everyone...

47
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:17,867
thanks a lot!

48
00:02:17,867 --> 00:02:19,691
I'm getting choked up...

49
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:21,519
How kind you all are...

50
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:24,144
and how pathetic I am...

51
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,796
I want to change.

52
00:02:28,895 --> 00:02:31,284
Oh, and do you know what brand the cups are?

53
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:36,124
It says "H E R M E S" on the cups...

54
00:02:36,124 --> 00:02:37,199
Hermes!?

55
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,548
Hermes!?  Wow...

56
00:02:39,548 --> 00:02:41,243
It's pronounced "ERUMESU"
(this is closer to the real deal than the American way...)

57
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:43,420
E RU ME SU!
(this is closer to the real deal than the American way...)

58
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,402
Hermes as in the purse?

59
00:02:45,402 --> 00:02:49,519
I think...  she wouldn't have sent Hermes cups...
If she was just grateful...

60
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,961
Why don't you ask us while you talk to her?
We'll stand by to listen.

61
00:02:51,961 --> 00:03:00,713
You've got nothing to lose, right?

62
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:03,255
[Give it your best, Densha Otoko!]

63
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:19,943
I'm...  gonna call her now.

64
00:03:19,943 --> 00:03:25,206
Kita~

65
00:03:35,545 --> 00:03:38,489
I just realized something really important.

66
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:41,002
Our conversation snowballed and I ended up
making plans with Hermes...

67
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:44,467
but she'll just look down on an otaku like me.

68
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:45,376
What should I do?

69
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:46,431
Don't worry.

70
00:03:46,431 --> 00:03:48,060
The problem here is your looks.

71
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,496
If you get rid of those clothes...
(kibakaji = Akiba Casual = Otaku gear)

72
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:50,533
she won't find out you're an otaku.
(kibakaji = Akiba Casual = Otaku gear)

73
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:51,647
Changing how you look on the outside...

74
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:52,771
will change you on the inside.

75
00:03:52,771 --> 00:03:55,914
From clothes to conversation,
it's possible that we'll tutor him on everything.

76
00:03:55,914 --> 00:03:58,344
Looks like we all have to get together to
primp and preen Densha.

77
00:03:58,344 --> 00:04:03,112
Densha Otoko Modification Project

78
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:05,268
First...  The hairstyle!

79
00:04:05,268 --> 00:04:06,754
Blonde hair is a fashion faux pas

80
00:04:06,754 --> 00:04:07,610
but you should get some highlights.

81
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,554
I think you can let the employees decide.

82
00:04:09,554 --> 00:04:12,098
Want to have some impact?
Go for some corn twists or locks!

83
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:14,559
Short hair will give her the best impression.

84
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:17,566
Aren't you gonna panic when the employees ask?

85
00:04:17,566 --> 00:04:24,105
You can overcome this...
For Hermes.

86
00:04:27,943 --> 00:04:29,782
U...um...

87
00:04:29,782 --> 00:04:30,850
How...

88
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,168
do I look?

89
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:38,853
Actually, I wasn't thinking so far ahead...

90
00:04:38,853 --> 00:04:43,137
where I envisioned us going out or anything.

91
00:04:43,137 --> 00:04:44,396
But...

92
00:04:44,396 --> 00:04:48,140
I'm definitely being drawn closer to her.

93
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,081
If I see her...  I'm definitely gonna fall for her.

94
00:04:52,081 --> 00:04:55,141
Of course, she might be with someone...

95
00:04:55,141 --> 00:05:00,351
and if I still end up liking her,
I might end up getting hurt.

96
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:04,508
You know, it kinda hurts.

97
00:05:04,508 --> 00:05:05,775
But..

98
00:05:05,775 --> 00:05:07,793
a bitter bachelor like me

99
00:05:07,793 --> 00:05:09,686
being able to think like this

100
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:11,537
is quite a feat

101
00:05:11,537 --> 00:05:15,459
and I owe everyone for that.

102
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:17,194
Everyone...

103
00:05:17,194 --> 00:05:20,175
thank you so much.

104
00:05:20,175 --> 00:05:26,287
Thanks for your kind feelings.

105
00:05:26,287 --> 00:05:27,732
I...

106
00:05:27,732 --> 00:05:29,082
I'll push myself.

107
00:05:37,701 --> 00:05:40,236
I was practically a nervous wreck...

108
00:05:40,236 --> 00:05:43,775
over walking side by side with a woman.

109
00:05:43,775 --> 00:05:45,098
If I walk normally

110
00:05:45,098 --> 00:05:47,081
I end up leaving her behind.

111
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:48,625
To top it off..

112
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:49,947
She looks better...

113
00:05:49,947 --> 00:05:52,143
than when I saw her last time.

114
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,432
A guy like me...

115
00:05:53,432 --> 00:05:54,860
with a girl like her...

116
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,851
walking together...

117
00:05:57,851 --> 00:05:59,611
I really worried that we didn't look right at all.

118
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:00,460
I mean, look at us.

119
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,122
She's way taller than me.

120
00:06:02,122 --> 00:06:05,621
I felt like everyone was staring at me.

121
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:17,318
It's okay.

122
00:06:17,318 --> 00:06:20,070
I'll hold on to you.

123
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:30,371
I was so surprised...
I jolted and cringed a little.

124
00:06:30,371 --> 00:06:32,397
Why the heck did you let go?

125
00:06:32,397 --> 00:06:34,568
Hold her hand!

126
00:06:34,568 --> 00:06:40,122
I'll hold on to you.
I'll hold on to you.
I'll hold on to you.

127
00:06:40,122 --> 00:06:44,563
I mean, I wanted her to hold on...

128
00:06:44,563 --> 00:06:49,377
Actually, I told her I'd rather her hold my hand.

129
00:07:01,914 --> 00:07:02,608
Hi.

130
00:07:02,608 --> 00:07:03,188
Mr. Yamada!

131
00:07:03,188 --> 00:07:05,175
The first lot limited edition Mina DVD box...

132
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,739
Did you forget it was coming out tomorrow?

133
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:09,480
The first lot, as a special feature...

134
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,589
has the storyboards for the legendary episode 7!

135
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:18,399
At this rate, it'll be sold out in the blink of an eye.

136
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,598
I'm sorry.

137
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:22,412
I have a more pressing matter to deal with.

138
00:07:22,412 --> 00:07:27,220
I'm really sorry.

139
00:07:29,486 --> 00:07:30,377
Well...

140
00:07:30,377 --> 00:07:31,885
I mentioned this before...

141
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,420
but because of a small communication lapse...

142
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,058
she thinks I like to go surfing.

143
00:07:36,058 --> 00:07:37,571
No worries.

144
00:07:37,571 --> 00:07:39,814
I'll bestow upon you the art of quickly learning how to surf.

145
00:07:39,814 --> 00:07:42,110
If you just have to stand on a board,
it'll work out, I think.

146
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,045
Okay, let's Google some info and give Densha some tips.

147
00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:49,804
Everyone, thanks.  I'll give it a shot.

148
00:07:58,362 --> 00:08:00,802
It's okay if you can't surf.

149
00:08:00,802 --> 00:08:05,103
Just keep in mind that you lied to her.

150
00:08:05,103 --> 00:08:06,603
What's important

151
00:08:06,603 --> 00:08:09,241
is that you think hard for Hermes's sake

152
00:08:09,241 --> 00:08:12,033
and come up with a solution.

153
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,452
I'm sorry.

154
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:14,922
I...

155
00:08:14,922 --> 00:08:17,428
don't know how to surf.

156
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:19,169
I...

157
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:20,848
I lied...

158
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:23,378
to you.

159
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,790
Lied?

160
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,067
I'm really sorry

161
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:33,686
about deceiving you.

162
00:08:33,686 --> 00:08:35,173
You know...

163
00:08:35,173 --> 00:08:37,042
I can't deny my otaku-ness.

164
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:38,185
If I hide my otaku-ness

165
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,317
I'd be lying to her.

166
00:08:40,317 --> 00:08:41,703
You're worrying too much.

167
00:08:41,703 --> 00:08:43,790
Everyone has secrets.

168
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,279
There's no need to hide it.

169
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,115
Your otaku-ness defines who you are.

170
00:08:47,115 --> 00:08:50,899
You'll be loyal to her by telling her that you're an otaku.

171
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:53,463
Everyone, thanks for your serious replies.

172
00:08:53,463 --> 00:08:56,908
I know it's a hopeless gamble.

173
00:08:56,908 --> 00:09:02,841
But...  I can't lie to her.

174
00:09:02,841 --> 00:09:04,309
I

175
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:05,399
I'll show Hermes

176
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,741
my otaku side too!

177
00:09:09,741 --> 00:09:13,658
I'm...

178
00:09:13,658 --> 00:09:17,018
an otaku.

179
00:09:17,018 --> 00:09:19,090
I know it can't be helped

180
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,948
if people think I'm lame

181
00:09:20,948 --> 00:09:28,527
or gross.

182
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:31,715
But...

183
00:09:31,715 --> 00:09:34,132
this is...

184
00:09:34,132 --> 00:09:42,375
the only way I know how to live.

185
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:48,378
I didn't want to lie to you.

186
00:09:48,424 --> 00:09:50,741
So...

187
00:09:50,741 --> 00:09:53,637
I wanted you to see

188
00:09:53,637 --> 00:09:56,916
who I really am.

[Jinkama-san]

190
00:10:15,122 --> 00:10:15,673
Hello?

191
00:10:15,673 --> 00:10:17,417
Where the hell are you?

192
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:20,624
I'm staying late at work and you don't even show up to say hi?

193
00:10:20,624 --> 00:10:22,928
Get over here - it's not too late.

194
00:10:22,928 --> 00:10:24,335
i'm sorry.

195
00:10:24,335 --> 00:10:26,179
I've got something really important going on today...

196
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:27,175
Huh?

197
00:10:27,175 --> 00:10:29,029
You gonna talk back to me?

198
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:29,630
You know...

199
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,936
I'm priority #1 for you!

200
00:10:31,936 --> 00:10:34,140
Today is no good.

201
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,546
I have...

202
00:10:35,546 --> 00:10:38,205
the most important promise of my life to keep.

203
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:39,950
Huh?

204
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:46,702
I'm really sorry.

205
00:10:46,702 --> 00:10:54,224
That's the first time he said 'no...'

206
00:10:54,224 --> 00:10:55,550
On this message board...

207
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:00,268
I've written down everything that's happened between us.

208
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:03,167
From her point of view...

209
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,126
that might be a terrible thing.

210
00:11:06,126 --> 00:11:07,467
But...

211
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,837
If I hadn't posted on this message board...

212
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:15,340
I would never have been able to see her alone.

213
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,204
If I hadn't posted on this message board...

214
00:11:18,204 --> 00:11:19,436
I never would have...

215
00:11:19,436 --> 00:11:24,320
learned to like myself so much.

216
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,970
And, most important of all...

217
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:32,599
I wouldn't have met so many wonderful friends.

218
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:35,970
Because you guys were always there for me...

219
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:40,382
I was able to push myself to this point.

220
00:11:41,988 --> 00:11:44,287
This message board

221
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:47,078
is something I'm really proud of.

222
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:48,827
And that's why..

223
00:11:48,827 --> 00:11:50,174
I'm gonna get up

224
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:51,849
and tell Hermes

225
00:11:51,849 --> 00:11:55,300
about this message board.

226
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,240

Everyone's important thoughts...

228
00:12:02,935 --> 00:12:06,935
I want her to understand it all.

229
00:12:25,492 --> 00:12:27,455
Dear Hermes:

230
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,472
I'm sure, after reading this message board

231
00:12:29,472 --> 00:12:34,052
you were surprised in many different ways.

232
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:37,661
I myself feel embarassed...

233
00:12:37,661 --> 00:12:39,959
nostalgic...

234
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,202
and a little funny.

235
00:12:43,202 --> 00:12:44,806
But

236
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,626
There are no lies or deceptions

237
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:50,702
in the words you read here.

238
00:12:50,702 --> 00:12:52,213
And that

239
00:12:52,213 --> 00:12:55,088
I can say about everyone on the 'net

240
00:12:55,088 --> 00:12:58,368
I don't know their names or faces...

241
00:12:58,368 --> 00:13:00,289
but the guys and girls...

242
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:02,982
I really...

243
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,102
think of them as true friends.

244
00:13:06,102 --> 00:13:07,830
If I could choose

245
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:11,173
one thing that I could really be proud of

246
00:13:11,173 --> 00:13:13,056
it would be that I was able to bump into them.

247
00:13:13,056 --> 00:13:17,581
I'm so proud of that, too.

248
00:13:17,581 --> 00:13:19,578
It was because of those guys

249
00:13:19,578 --> 00:13:20,805
I...

250
00:13:20,805 --> 00:13:27,412
didn't give up on you.

251
00:13:27,412 --> 00:13:29,391
It was because of them

252
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,965
I...

253
00:13:30,965 --> 00:13:37,630
made up my mind to tell you how I feel.

254
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,746
Tomorrow

255
00:13:39,746 --> 00:13:45,726
I'll be waiting at our secret place.

256
00:13:45,726 --> 00:13:49,790
I'll be waiting until you show up.

257
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:54,358
Finally

258
00:13:54,358 --> 00:13:56,951
I wanted to apologize

259
00:13:56,951 --> 00:13:59,103
for writing about you without your permission

260
00:13:59,103 --> 00:14:01,564
and hurting you as a result.

you really have grown up.

I'm awed, even as your enemy.

266

But...

267
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:48,550
I'll let you know that even then
there's a wall too high to be climbed.

This...

269
00:14:50,274 --> 00:14:57,369
is the FINAL ROUND.

Hello?

271
00:14:58,118 --> 00:15:00,476
Bad news - Saori collapsed.

272
00:15:00,476 --> 00:15:01,204
What?

273
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:03,382
She's at the nearby hospital.

274
00:15:03,382 --> 00:15:05,970
She was calling out your name while coming
in and out of consciousness.

275
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,687
Please go to her.

276

Hey hey!  For tonight's special guest,
live from a concert stage

286
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,048
Sambo Master will be playing a brand new song!

287
00:15:59,048 --> 00:16:00,911
It's actually a song

288
00:16:00,911 --> 00:16:04,652
for a guy named Densha Otoko
on the now famous A Channel.

289
00:16:04,652 --> 00:16:05,763
All right, Sambo Master

290
00:16:05,763 --> 00:16:06,984
Let's hear your cry for love and send out some courage

291
00:16:06,984 --> 00:16:09,388
for the Densha Otoko somewhere out there!

292
00:16:10,115 --> 00:16:12,872
I don't know your name...

293
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:16,787
I don't know your past...

294
00:16:16,787 --> 00:16:19,290
I don't what kind of guy you are!

295
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,537
For a guy like you...  You know it!

296
00:16:21,537 --> 00:16:24,425
That's what the world calls love!

297
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:29,903
Hey listen to Nippon Broadcasting!

298
00:17:29,903 --> 00:17:32,786
They're playing a song that someone wrote for Densha!

299
00:17:43,983 --> 00:17:45,480
Such a good song...

300
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,204
I can't stand how weak my tear ducts are these days

301
00:17:47,204 --> 00:17:48,888
I hope Densha and Hermes are listening

302
00:17:48,888 --> 00:17:51,516
Not just Densha, but we're getting patted on the back, too!

303
00:17:51,516 --> 00:17:53,290
Our duty is to wait for Densha until he comes home

304
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,369
and reports to us.

305
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:56,646
Is there a chance that Hermes still hasn't read these posts...?

306
00:17:56,646 --> 00:17:58,285
There's a huge chance it hasn't happened!
Normal people wouldn't look!

307
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,653
If she reads this...  I hope she'll...

308
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:05,031
Hermes...  Please come to the secret place!

309
00:18:05,031 --> 00:18:09,053
Can you stop the car?

310
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:10,225
Thanks.

311
00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:15,186
Okay...

312
00:18:15,186 --> 00:18:17,907
the climax is just around the corner.

313
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,294
These are Yamada's...

314
00:18:57,684 --> 00:18:59,575
Hi, this is Yamada

315
00:18:59,575 --> 00:19:01,732
I'm at the hospital where Saori was taken to

316
00:19:01,732 --> 00:19:03,737
but I was told that she wasn't here...

317
00:19:03,737 --> 00:19:04,641
Huh?

318
00:19:04,641 --> 00:19:05,570
Wait wait wait

319
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,257
This has to be some kind of mistake.

320
00:19:07,257 --> 00:19:09,330
Sis just left the house not too long ago.

321
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:12,432
Really?

322
00:19:12,432 --> 00:19:15,377
Yeah.  She had a really serious expression on her face
and left pretty quickly.

323
00:19:15,377 --> 00:19:17,125
'pretty quickly?'

324
00:19:17,471 --> 00:19:18,765
Got it.

325
00:19:18,765 --> 00:19:20,347
Hey, you know...

326
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:21,650
Yes?

327
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:25,178
I read the message board.

328
00:19:27,005 --> 00:19:28,517
Oh...

329
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:30,916
I really understood

330
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,851
that you're pretty serious

331
00:19:32,851 --> 00:19:37,506
about my sister.

332
00:19:37,506 --> 00:19:40,107
I'm sorry about punching you.

333
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:45,556
I'm sure she'll understand.

334
00:19:45,741 --> 00:19:47,622
Thank you.

335
00:19:47,622 --> 00:19:57,688
Now, if you'll excuse me...

336
00:19:57,688 --> 00:20:03,881
So this is the secret place...

337
00:20:03,881 --> 00:20:05,970
Maybe Yamada

338
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,338
thought that he wasn't good enough for you...

339
00:20:08,338 --> 00:20:11,170
and ran away...

340
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:14,243
Wha...  Saori

341
00:20:14,243 --> 00:20:15,796
Okay

342
00:20:15,796 --> 00:20:16,957
For now

343
00:20:16,957 --> 00:20:28,169
things are going as planned.

344
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:31,209
[Densha Otoko, come back to the message board!]

345
00:21:01,777 --> 00:21:05,272
[Densha Otoko, please come back to the message board!]

346
00:21:28,456 --> 00:21:29,183
Hello?

347
00:21:29,183 --> 00:21:30,026
Saori

348
00:21:30,026 --> 00:21:31,792
I found Yamada.

349
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:34,325
He's at the train station platform.  You have to come now.

350
00:21:34,325 --> 00:21:35,650
Okay.

351
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,647
Where's Yamada-san?

352
00:21:49,647 --> 00:21:51,831
Yamada...

353
00:21:51,831 --> 00:21:54,560
said he wasn't good enough for you

354
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,790
and left.

355
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,030
Saori

356
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:17,580
Let's get married!

357
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,181
As he was leaving, he told me this.

358
00:22:21,181 --> 00:22:23,120
I'm leaving things up to you.

359
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,333
Please make Saori happy.

360
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:27,958
Kazuya-san...

361
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:34,423
Saori

362
00:22:34,423 --> 00:22:42,139
What the...

363
00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:55,299
Saori!

364
00:22:55,299 --> 00:22:58,230
Yamada...

365
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,893
told me that he wasn't good enough for you

366
00:23:00,893 --> 00:23:10,088
and left.

367
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:11,814
Saori

368
00:23:11,814 --> 00:23:14,631
Let's get married.

369
00:23:23,942 --> 00:23:29,549
Aoyama-san...

370
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:33,023
Kazuya-san

371
00:23:33,023 --> 00:23:34,067
Thank you.

372
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:36,403
Nah...

373
00:23:36,403 --> 00:23:37,959
Yamada

374
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:39,711
Now it's up to you.

375
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:43,563
Make Saori happy.

376
00:23:43,563 --> 00:23:45,638
Shoot, I might as well take her by force...

377
00:23:45,638 --> 00:23:46,909
This is real!

378
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:49,032
Seriously!  We're so lucky!

379
00:23:49,032 --> 00:23:50,252
It's so hard!

380
00:23:50,252 --> 00:23:52,426
Wait a minute.

381
00:23:52,426 --> 00:23:54,176
Hey, you girls are...

382
00:23:54,176 --> 00:23:55,551
Shit!

383
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:59,283
That diamond ring!

384
00:23:59,283 --> 00:24:00,295
Sorry sorry!

385
00:24:00,295 --> 00:24:00,839
Watch it asshole!

386
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:04,032
It's an emergency!

387
00:24:04,032 --> 00:24:06,762
(잘 모르겠네요..ㅠㅠ 거기서 정도인가? -.-;;)

388
00:24:06,762 --> 00:24:09,475
Dammit, that's my Lancer!
("Lanevo" = Lancer Evolution)

389
00:24:09,475 --> 00:24:10,186
Dammit!

390
00:24:10,186 --> 00:24:11,896
Shit!

391
00:24:11,896 --> 00:24:21,172
I'll have to use my No. 2

392
00:24:21,172 --> 00:24:22,739
What're you doing!?

393
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:24,841
Where are you taking it?

394
00:24:24,841 --> 00:24:26,021
Ring!

395
00:24:26,021 --> 00:24:27,838
Lancers!

396
00:24:27,838 --> 00:24:30,195
Hermes!

397
00:24:30,195 --> 00:24:33,489
Come back!

398
00:24:43,475 --> 00:24:45,119
Um...

399
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:49,414
We finally meet

400
00:24:50,086 --> 00:24:52,359
Densha Otoko.

401
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,795
Densha

402
00:24:59,795 --> 00:25:05,234
He's still not back...

403
00:25:05,234 --> 00:25:08,626
I haven't gotten an ounce of sleep

404
00:25:08,626 --> 00:25:10,948
because I've been watching this message board since last night.

405
00:25:10,948 --> 00:25:15,558
is everyone awake?

406
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:18,975
I'm fading in and out of consciousness...
But this is for Densha!  I'll wait...

407
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:22,697
Sleepy...  So sleepy...

408
00:25:22,697 --> 00:25:25,765
I can't...  I have to sleep.
Peace out.

409
00:25:25,765 --> 00:25:28,302
The legendary heroes fall one by one.

410
00:25:28,302 --> 00:25:32,105
Feeling the weight of their anguish,
a lonely bachelor...  falls asleep.

411
00:25:32,105 --> 00:25:34,555
I want to welcome him home for the last time

412
00:25:34,555 --> 00:25:35,989
So that's why I'm up, but...

413
00:25:35,989 --> 00:25:40,198
I can't hold out any longer.

414
00:25:40,198 --> 00:25:44,403
I just got back home.

415
00:25:44,403 --> 00:25:45,989
Densha?

416
00:25:45,989 --> 00:25:48,251
Is that really you?

417
00:25:48,251 --> 00:25:53,537
He's back!

418
00:25:55,356 --> 00:26:00,505
I wonder how long it'll take me to write everything down
So sleepy...

419
00:26:00,505 --> 00:26:03,782
I know you're sleepy, but please tell us what happened!

420
00:26:03,782 --> 00:26:06,846
Yeah - we were chatting for half a day while waiting for your return!

421
00:26:06,846 --> 00:26:09,708
My having waited 15 hours...  Makes me a winner!

422
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:11,268
Sorry for the wait.

423
00:26:11,268 --> 00:26:12,820
Should I tell you the result first?

424
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,612
Nono, the main point should be at the end!

425
00:26:14,612 --> 00:26:18,108
Please...  Please toy with us slowly and painfully!

426
00:26:18,108 --> 00:26:19,835
Please report the results at the last stop.

427
00:26:19,835 --> 00:26:21,386
Everyone...  Let's go together!

428
00:26:21,386 --> 00:26:23,734
My pulse is going out of control!

429
00:26:23,734 --> 00:26:25,864
I'm so nervous I'm making my computer desk shake!

430
00:26:25,864 --> 00:26:27,435
Now, the largest and most powerful bombing in this thread

431
00:26:27,435 --> 00:26:32,316
one that will surely go down in the annals of history
shall begin...

432
00:26:32,316 --> 00:26:34,766
Then I'll start.

433
00:26:34,766 --> 00:26:39,004
I stayed at the spot since noon like I said

434
00:26:39,004 --> 00:26:41,745
and visualized how I would tell her how I felt.

435
00:26:41,745 --> 00:26:46,772
Then, someone called and said that Hermes collapsed.

436
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,270
That was actually not true

437
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,679
I left the hospital quickly

438
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,024
and went back to my hideout.

439
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:52,977
And then...

440
00:26:52,977 --> 00:26:54,084
By sheer coincidence

441
00:26:54,084 --> 00:26:55,473
I bumped into Hermes

442
00:26:55,473 --> 00:26:57,056
at the train station.

443
00:26:57,056 --> 00:26:58,628
This is so dramatic.

444
00:26:58,628 --> 00:27:01,589
It really seems like you two were destined to meet.

445
00:27:01,589 --> 00:27:02,993
Good job on the description!

446
00:27:02,993 --> 00:27:05,257
Good job to whoever gave Densha that falese info!

447
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:06,179
Don't mention it.

448
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:07,731
She and I

449
00:27:07,731 --> 00:27:11,432
decided to go back to our secret place.

450
00:27:11,432 --> 00:27:13,045
During that time

451
00:27:13,045 --> 00:27:15,373
Hermes stayed silent.

452
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:18,499
Of course, me too.

453
00:27:18,499 --> 00:27:20,611
And then

454
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:23,722
the silence was broken.

455
00:27:23,722 --> 00:27:26,512
I read the message board.

456
00:27:27,703 --> 00:27:30,864
Yeah.

457
00:27:30,864 --> 00:27:34,948
After reading that message board

458
00:27:34,948 --> 00:27:36,826
I understood how you felt

459
00:27:36,826 --> 00:27:38,287
in really depending

460
00:27:38,287 --> 00:27:41,772
on the people there for a helping hand.

461
00:27:41,772 --> 00:27:45,518
And...

462
00:27:45,518 --> 00:27:46,878
I also understood

463
00:27:46,878 --> 00:27:48,426
how you felt about me

464
00:27:48,426 --> 00:27:51,534
thanks to the posts.

465
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,083
It made me happy.

466
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:09,233
Yamada-san,

467
00:28:09,233 --> 00:28:12,437
the fact that you thought about me so much

468
00:28:12,437 --> 00:28:18,580
really made me happy.

469
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,286
The people on the message board

470
00:28:21,286 --> 00:28:25,083
are really kindhearted.

471
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:38,139
Yes.

472
00:28:38,139 --> 00:28:43,121
So...

473
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,330
I came up here because

474
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:51,646
I wanted to hear from you
how you felt about me.

475
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:15,685
Could you please tell me?

476
00:29:15,685 --> 00:29:18,204
Yes.

477
00:29:18,204 --> 00:29:20,337
Here it comes...  Here it comes!

478
00:29:20,337 --> 00:29:21,538
Hermes moe~

479
00:29:21,538 --> 00:29:24,691
"Could you please tell me" means that, now...!

480
00:29:24,691 --> 00:29:26,080
It's confession time!

481
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,954
The train is suddenly climbing up!

482
00:29:27,954 --> 00:29:30,556
An attack that no trench, air raid hat, or fallout shelter can shield

483
00:29:30,556 --> 00:29:31,966
is about to hit us!!

484
00:29:31,966 --> 00:29:34,217
For the first time in my life,
the feeling you get when you're about to finish an RPG

485
00:29:34,217 --> 00:29:36,331
has come back to me in real life!

486
00:29:36,331 --> 00:29:38,747
Everyone, after the next hit, I probably won't be around anymore.

487
00:29:38,747 --> 00:29:40,197
So let these be my parting words.

488
00:29:40,197 --> 00:29:42,111
I love you guys!

489
00:29:42,111 --> 00:29:44,570
O~!  I'm gonna run through the city naked!

490
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:47,281
I'm so excited, words are asdfa;dslkj;aldkjf

491
00:29:47,281 --> 00:29:52,779
Let's see what you got!

492
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:57,051
For a while, time passed by without a word being uttered.

493
00:29:57,051 --> 00:30:00,121
I was so nervous..

494
00:30:00,121 --> 00:30:02,768
that I couldn't speak.

495
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:17,999
I..  have something very important to say.

496
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:28,808
Yes.

497
00:30:28,808 --> 00:30:32,367
When I'm with you, Aoyama-san...

498
00:30:32,367 --> 00:30:38,167
everything really shined.

499
00:30:38,167 --> 00:30:40,713
All the meaningless time

500
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,436
I...

501
00:30:42,436 --> 00:30:44,879
I was spending until now...

502
00:30:44,879 --> 00:30:49,026
The unchanging cityscape...

503
00:30:49,026 --> 00:30:52,045
and my really pitiful self

504
00:30:52,045 --> 00:30:54,330
from back then...

505
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,553
Everything

506
00:30:56,553 --> 00:30:58,273
suddenly started to shine

507
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:03,325
like a spell was cast.

508
00:31:03,325 --> 00:31:06,286
Aoyama-san...

509
00:31:06,286 --> 00:31:08,945
it's because you let

510
00:31:08,945 --> 00:31:15,696
light shine on me.

511
00:31:15,696 --> 00:31:23,419
I've received so much from you, Aoyama-san...

512
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:32,861
But...

513
00:31:32,861 --> 00:31:35,472
I...

514
00:31:35,472 --> 00:31:39,172
don't have anything to give.

515
00:31:39,172 --> 00:31:46,544
There's nothing I can do for you.

516
00:31:46,544 --> 00:31:49,945
But...

517
00:31:49,945 --> 00:31:55,304
But...

518
00:31:55,304 --> 00:31:57,879
these feelings I have...

519
00:31:57,879 --> 00:32:03,201
these feelings i have for you, Aoyama-san...

520
00:32:03,201 --> 00:32:05,861
nobody...

521
00:32:07,647 --> 00:32:09,335
nobody...

522
00:32:09,335 --> 00:32:15,187
feels this way more than I do.

523
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:25,387
I...

524
00:32:27,149 --> 00:32:34,639
I...

525
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:48,341
You can do it.

526
00:33:02,378 --> 00:33:07,186
I...

527
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:13,328
I...

528
00:33:13,328 --> 00:33:13,834
Aoyama-san...

529
00:33:13,834 --> 00:33:24,081
Aoyama-san...

530
00:33:24,081 --> 00:33:37,000
I really like you.

531
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,791
I...

532
00:33:39,791 --> 00:33:42,646
feel the same way...

533
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:52,785
about you too, Yamada-san.

534
00:33:52,785 --> 00:33:55,352
So...

535
00:33:55,352 --> 00:33:57,938
From now on...

536
00:33:57,938 --> 00:34:04,354
will you be with me...?

537
00:34:04,354 --> 00:34:07,908
Yes

538
00:34:15,827 --> 00:34:20,214
Thank you

539
00:34:20,214 --> 00:34:22,596
Always...

540
00:34:22,596 --> 00:34:24,828
Always...

541
00:34:24,828 --> 00:34:28,717
Please be with me...  always.

542
00:34:28,737 --> 00:34:34,064
Yes.

543
00:34:34,064 --> 00:34:36,275
I'm sorry

544
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:38,559
I...

545
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:40,924
I really...

546
00:34:40,924 --> 00:34:55,473
Aoyama-san, I really...

547
00:34:55,473 --> 00:34:57,322
I'm sorry.

548
00:34:57,322 --> 00:34:58,980
No girl

549
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,150
has ever treated me nicely...

550
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:06,224
Not once...

551
00:35:16,431 --> 00:35:18,541
Now you've...

552
00:35:18,541 --> 00:35:21,199
started to make me cry.

553
00:35:40,901 --> 00:35:46,431
You kissed her!!

554
00:35:55,147 --> 00:35:58,406
After telling you how I felt...

555
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:02,427
I like you even more now...

556
00:36:13,334 --> 00:36:14,720
No more!

557
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,739
i have no regrets in my life!

558
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:18,785
Now I'm starting to cry!

559
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:20,596
I'm ALREADY crying!

560
00:36:22,026 --> 00:36:25,729
My tears, for once, are shining like pearls.

561
00:36:25,729 --> 00:36:28,551
With all these tears, I think my body is losing all its water!

562
00:36:28,551 --> 00:36:31,839
If my dad came in right now,
how would I explain these tears to him?

563
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,828
Spring has arrived~
Spring has arrived~

564
00:36:35,828 --> 00:36:38,499
Where has it arrived~?

565
00:36:38,499 --> 00:36:39,968
It arrived for Densha~

566
00:36:39,968 --> 00:36:41,696
It arrived for Hermes~

567
00:36:41,696 --> 00:36:45,156
To the bachelors...  Venoa!

568
00:36:45,156 --> 00:36:45,866
Densha

569
00:36:45,866 --> 00:36:46,826
Congratulations

570
00:36:47,212 --> 00:36:48,319
To everyone on this thread

571
00:36:48,319 --> 00:36:50,335
We all did well.

572
00:36:50,335 --> 00:36:51,324
You're the greatest!

573
00:36:51,324 --> 00:36:52,442
So did you do it?

574
00:36:52,442 --> 00:36:53,941
Did you do it!?

575
00:36:53,941 --> 00:36:55,813
This year's MVP goes to you, Densha.

576
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,787
Your hobbies and interests don't matter anymore.

577
00:36:57,787 --> 00:36:58,875
The truth is

578
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:01,036
that two people fallen for each other are right there!

579
00:37:01,036 --> 00:37:02,644
It doesn't matter if you're an otaku...

580
00:37:02,644 --> 00:37:04,967
or an ex-bachelor.

581
00:37:04,967 --> 00:37:06,436
Make her happy as best as you can

582
00:37:06,436 --> 00:37:07,161
and you be happy, too!

583
00:37:07,161 --> 00:37:08,475
I'm crying in real life now!

584
00:37:08,475 --> 00:37:10,019
Tears are falling from my eyes, too.

585
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,322
Densha's anxiety

586
00:37:11,322 --> 00:37:12,612
his life up to now

587
00:37:12,612 --> 00:37:13,843
and his life going forward

588
00:37:13,843 --> 00:37:15,952
I think everything is there

589
00:37:15,952 --> 00:37:18,371
for the sake of her happiness.

590
00:37:18,371 --> 00:37:21,099
Thinking about what happened is making me cry again.

591
00:37:21,099 --> 00:37:23,713
Don't worry - I've cried twice as much as you have.

592
00:37:23,713 --> 00:37:25,854
This is the first time someone else's story has made me cry.

593
00:37:25,854 --> 00:37:27,298
There's something coming out of my ear

594
00:37:27,298 --> 00:37:28,896
But nobody's here to wipe it off.

595
00:37:28,896 --> 00:37:31,367
Are there really girls as pure as she is in Tokyo?
(I doubt it...)

596
00:37:31,367 --> 00:37:33,083
Is this the 'Japanese Dream?'

597
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:35,883
Cute?  Pure?
Older girl who'll take care of you?

598
00:37:35,883 --> 00:37:37,518
Are they really out there?
Are they really out there?

599
00:37:37,518 --> 00:37:40,044
Will there be some left for me?

600
00:37:40,044 --> 00:37:42,708
Is Hermes the last one?

601
00:37:42,708 --> 00:37:44,430
The final weapon has finally arrived!
(for like the 3rd time in this series)

602
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,909
I stop by to look, and there's nobody there!

603
00:37:45,909 --> 00:37:49,261
Am I...  still...  alive...

604
00:37:50,629 --> 00:37:52,177
You're really the man.

605
00:37:52,177 --> 00:37:52,959
Congratulations!

606
00:37:52,959 --> 00:37:54,320
Let us know where the wedding is!

607
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:01,694
Sergeant Densha, are there any unfinished items left?

608
00:38:01,694 --> 00:38:03,061
Yes, there are...

609
00:38:03,061 --> 00:38:04,789
but Mina is about to come on

610
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:06,962
so I'll finish this up later.

611
00:38:06,962 --> 00:38:08,637
We have to wait for an anime now?

612
00:38:08,637 --> 00:38:11,116
It's cruel to have an intermission here!

613
00:38:11,116 --> 00:38:13,866
You got us there.
You really are an anime otaku!

614
00:38:13,866 --> 00:38:15,172
Hey, so what's Mina?

615
00:38:15,172 --> 00:38:16,802
"Moon Surface Bunny Weapon Mina"

616
00:38:16,802 --> 00:38:17,964
You can Google the rest.

617
00:38:17,964 --> 00:38:22,594
I really love you, man!

618
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:33,141
To think that he found Hermes thanks to me...
That piece of shit Densha...

619
00:38:33,141 --> 00:38:34,992
Who cares about an anime break?

620
00:38:34,992 --> 00:38:37,456
He should put himself in my shoes!

621
00:38:37,456 --> 00:38:40,096
Teasing us all along...

622
00:38:40,096 --> 00:38:42,845
I'm gonna beat him to a pulp when I see him again.

623
00:38:42,845 --> 00:38:45,783
<sigh> But I really do want to see what it's like...

624
00:38:45,783 --> 00:38:49,408
A romance with such a fateful beginning...

625
00:38:49,408 --> 00:38:50,827
Hey, you!

626
00:38:50,827 --> 00:38:52,781
The hell are you fiddling with your cell for?
(if you saw the episode of "Trivia no Izumi" where...)

627
00:38:52,781 --> 00:38:55,583
You should try to fidget with me down here!
(they studied otakus in Akihabara...)

628
00:39:03,698 --> 00:39:06,886
You're 10 years too young to be with me!
(then this guy is really familiar...)

629
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:07,786
Stop!

630
00:39:07,786 --> 00:39:11,004
Can't you see she's bothered by what you're doing?

631
00:39:11,004 --> 00:39:14,429
He's scary!

632
00:39:14,429 --> 00:39:23,305
What the...?  I was being beat up by this girl, and...

633
00:39:23,305 --> 00:39:24,223
Are you okay?

634
00:39:24,223 --> 00:39:25,470
Thank you.

635
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,402
Have we met before?

636
00:39:26,402 --> 00:39:27,632
I was thinking the same thing!

637
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:29,110
Is this...

638
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,090
Fate?

639
00:39:35,617 --> 00:39:37,985
I didn't get anything...

640
00:39:50,967 --> 00:39:52,363
She and I

641
00:39:52,363 --> 00:39:53,830
left our special spot

642
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:56,477
and wandered around for a while.

643
00:39:56,477 --> 00:40:01,295
Eventually, we came to a park.

644
00:40:01,295 --> 00:40:05,464
And then, we sat on an empty bench, but...

645
00:40:05,464 --> 00:40:10,188
was there a time when we sat so close to each other?

646
00:40:10,188 --> 00:40:12,474
Probably not.

647
00:40:12,474 --> 00:40:15,515
All of the sudden...  Kita~

648
00:40:15,515 --> 00:40:17,828
And it's begun again!

649
00:40:17,828 --> 00:40:21,190
It's an attack like firing from a ship
to an enemy camp under truce!

650
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:28,966
I love Densha and how he starts again
like nothing happened!

651
00:40:28,966 --> 00:40:30,030
This

652
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:36,360
is a present I got you from when I went to Italy for work.

653
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:48,909
Please open it.

654
00:40:48,909 --> 00:40:50,374
This...

655
00:40:50,374 --> 00:40:52,535
looks really expensive...

656
00:40:52,535 --> 00:40:55,650
Not really.

657
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,121
I really appreciate this.

658
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:00,593
It's so nice...

659
00:41:00,593 --> 00:41:02,699
Thank you.

660
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:03,941
Really...

661
00:41:03,941 --> 00:41:05,619
Thank you so much.

662
00:41:05,619 --> 00:41:06,994
Don't mention it.

663
00:41:06,994 --> 00:41:18,391
Could you please put it on?

664
00:41:18,391 --> 00:41:22,285
Huh?

665
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,918
Thank you.

666
00:41:30,918 --> 00:41:33,406
It looks good on you.

667
00:41:33,406 --> 00:41:36,470
Thank you.

668
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:39,838
We're matching now.

669
00:41:54,193 --> 00:41:55,779
Huh?

670
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,606
No "yeah they're matching now!"s

671
00:41:57,606 --> 00:41:59,582
or "she got him a present!"s?

672
00:41:59,582 --> 00:42:01,686
No reaction?

673
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,016
Well, honestly...

674
00:42:03,016 --> 00:42:05,006
I wasn't imagining this far ahead...

675
00:42:05,006 --> 00:42:07,717
Our thought processes can't keep up anymore

676
00:42:07,717 --> 00:42:10,763
Or like, the enemies are too strong...

677
00:42:10,763 --> 00:42:12,043
I'm getting more pissed.

678
00:42:12,043 --> 00:42:13,967
Do things like this really happen?

679
00:42:13,967 --> 00:42:20,156
Not in my life.

680
00:42:20,156 --> 00:42:22,595
With things calmed down

681
00:42:22,595 --> 00:42:26,141
we talked about things we couldn't say before.

682
00:42:26,141 --> 00:42:29,455
Like how we ended up liking each other

683
00:42:29,455 --> 00:42:33,278
or what we were thinking...

684
00:42:33,278 --> 00:42:34,965
no matter how much we talked

685
00:42:34,965 --> 00:42:40,450
it seemed like we couldn't run out of things
to talk about.

686
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:44,660
At this point, I notice something strange.

687
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,591
One of my contacts

688
00:42:45,591 --> 00:42:48,317
is missing...

689
00:42:48,317 --> 00:42:50,289
Well, for a little while

690
00:42:50,289 --> 00:42:52,500
things felt a little strange...

691
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,139
but I think that's it.

692
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:59,291
Well, we should look for it then.

693
00:42:59,291 --> 00:43:02,084
Oh, it's disposable, so it's okay.

694
00:43:02,084 --> 00:43:03,988
I see.

695
00:43:03,988 --> 00:43:16,226
Yes.

696
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:19,397
Well, I can't see anything anymore.

697
00:43:21,025 --> 00:43:24,662
Can you not see how I look like anymore?

698
00:43:25,056 --> 00:43:26,817
I could actually see...

699
00:43:26,817 --> 00:43:29,257
but...

700
00:43:29,257 --> 00:43:34,580
No, I can't see it.

701
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:37,160
How about now?

702
00:43:41,397 --> 00:43:44,599
You knieving trickster!

703
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:48,016
Hermes-tan!  This person lied to you!

704
00:43:48,016 --> 00:43:52,345
Damn you for your continuous bombing!
You wanna kill us all?

705
00:43:52,345 --> 00:43:53,596
Wait a minute, guys!

706
00:43:53,596 --> 00:43:55,864
Am I the only one here who feels like
something isn't right?

707
00:43:55,864 --> 00:43:59,493
We can't hold our own!
The bombing is closing in on us!

708
00:43:59,493 --> 00:44:05,203
The final blow is about go come!
Abandon ship!  Abandon ship!

709
00:44:05,203 --> 00:44:06,648
This time

710
00:44:06,648 --> 00:44:09,101
Densha-san, you take the...

711
00:44:19,758 --> 00:44:22,181
Not there.

712
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:30,412
Right here.

713
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:42,199
Maybe it was for 2 to 3 seconds

714
00:44:42,199 --> 00:44:49,415
to think that there was something in this world so soft...
That's what I thought.

715
00:44:49,415 --> 00:44:50,533
For the first time

716
00:44:50,533 --> 00:44:51,920
I got a really good look

717
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,566
at her face.

718
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:56,476
It's as if I could see myself

719
00:44:56,476 --> 00:45:00,357
reflected on her eyes...

720
00:45:00,357 --> 00:45:03,103
We're being bombed!

721
00:45:09,919 --> 00:45:13,392
What's with this honeymoon atmosphere!?
I'm departing for the afterlife...

722
00:45:13,392 --> 00:45:14,821
Goodbye!

723
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:19,289
I'm done for.

724
00:45:19,289 --> 00:45:21,935
After that...  She...

725
00:45:21,935 --> 00:45:26,980
"I really care for you so much...
Densha-san"

726
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,726
She whispered that into my ear...

727
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,082
and she kissed me again.

728
00:45:31,082 --> 00:45:34,715
The Hermes in my mind is crumbling apart!

729
00:45:34,715 --> 00:45:36,672
If she told me "I care for you so much," I...

730
00:45:40,749 --> 00:45:42,028
And then

731
00:45:42,028 --> 00:45:44,575
our lips met several times

732
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,267
and finally...

733
00:45:46,267 --> 00:45:50,953
we exchanged a grown-up kiss!

734
00:45:52,095 --> 00:45:53,076
Wait a minute

735
00:45:53,076 --> 00:45:56,447
what's a grown-up kiss?

736
00:45:58,932 --> 00:46:01,391
Everyone's being shot from behind!

737
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:03,675
And that sums it up.

738
00:46:03,675 --> 00:46:05,835
Everyone... thanks!

739
00:46:05,835 --> 00:46:07,153
Now, I'm gonna get some rest.

740
00:46:07,153 --> 00:46:09,044
See you later!

741
00:46:35,461 --> 00:46:36,266
Give peace a chance!

742
00:46:36,266 --> 00:46:39,316
What do you mean,
"We can't go out?"

743
00:46:39,316 --> 00:46:41,616
If you're a man, just say it!

744
00:46:41,616 --> 00:46:45,171
Well, your ankles aren't sexy, err..

745
00:46:45,171 --> 00:46:47,867
Your ankles aren't my type!

746
00:46:47,867 --> 00:46:50,248
Are you saying that my legs are fat?

747
00:46:50,248 --> 00:46:52,562
Well, yes, if you want to be so bold...

748
00:46:52,562 --> 00:46:53,992
Normally, a guy like you...

749
00:46:53,992 --> 00:46:55,637
I would reject without a second thought!

750
00:46:55,637 --> 00:46:59,514
I hate myself for having compromised so much!

751
00:47:02,533 --> 00:47:04,562
Sorry to call you out.

752
00:47:04,562 --> 00:47:05,650
Actually...

753
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:07,439
before I listen to what you have to say

754
00:47:07,439 --> 00:47:09,555
I wanted to tell you something.

755
00:47:09,555 --> 00:47:11,983
Sorry.

756
00:47:11,983 --> 00:47:12,761
I

757
00:47:12,761 --> 00:47:13,984
didn't think about your feelings

758
00:47:13,984 --> 00:47:16,469
and was pushing my opinions on to you.

759
00:47:16,469 --> 00:47:17,306
Like, in a way,

760
00:47:17,306 --> 00:47:20,628
I felt like I was the one protecting you.

761
00:47:20,628 --> 00:47:22,869
But that wasn't really the case, was it?

762
00:47:22,869 --> 00:47:24,802
I was the one

763
00:47:24,802 --> 00:47:26,915
who was afraid of relationships

764
00:47:26,915 --> 00:47:29,033
and forgot about what was really important.

765
00:47:29,033 --> 00:47:31,091
That's not true.

766
00:47:31,091 --> 00:47:34,393
Kaho, because you were so concerned about me

767
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:38,300
I was able to face up to Yamada and see him eye to eye.

768
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,222
Saori

769
00:47:39,222 --> 00:47:41,724
I was going to tell you about me and Yamada-san...

770
00:47:41,724 --> 00:47:45,317
but I guess you already know.

771
00:47:45,317 --> 00:47:47,699
Congrats.

772
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:53,334
Hermes-san.

773
00:47:53,334 --> 00:47:56,963
Hey onii-chan, put your figures somewhere else!
(onii-chan = big brother)

774
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,191
The Tsuyoshi there...
Hurry up and sit down!

775
00:48:01,191 --> 00:48:03,421
Matilda?
(pwned by Gundam references...)

776
00:48:03,421 --> 00:48:05,853
Hey, what kind of nonsense are you talking about?

777
00:48:05,853 --> 00:48:08,198
Oh it's you, mom.
Your voices are so similar!

778
00:48:08,198 --> 00:48:12,973
We have to talk.
Sit down.

779
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,329
Well

780
00:48:14,329 --> 00:48:15,577
Your mother...

781
00:48:15,577 --> 00:48:17,597
is pregnant.

782
00:48:17,597 --> 00:48:18,577
It's true!

783
00:48:19,409 --> 00:48:20,896
Congratulations.

784
00:48:20,896 --> 00:48:21,715
Um, when?

785
00:48:21,715 --> 00:48:25,895
Well, the last time I came to stay
for my monthly night at home...

786
00:48:25,895 --> 00:48:28,201
Yeah I...  Worked a little hard.

787
00:48:28,201 --> 00:48:30,031
Amazing.

788
00:48:30,031 --> 00:48:31,614
Watch yourself.

789
00:48:31,614 --> 00:48:33,216
So what'll we name it?

790
00:48:33,216 --> 00:48:35,639
Well, don't you think it's a little early?

791
00:48:35,639 --> 00:48:37,451
I had an idea earlier...

792
00:48:37,451 --> 00:48:40,808
if it's a girl...  How about Matilda?

793
00:48:40,808 --> 00:48:42,192
I second that.

794
00:48:42,192 --> 00:48:43,835
Matilda...  That's great!

795
00:48:43,835 --> 00:48:46,982
How are you gonna write that in kanji?

796
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:54,345
I'm sorry.

797
00:48:54,345 --> 00:48:56,260
I came here a little late.

798
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,481
Hermes sent me a text message...

799
00:48:57,481 --> 00:49:01,483
she said:
"If only it was Sunday every day"

800
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:03,512
I'm...  So happy.

801
00:49:03,512 --> 00:49:05,449
Sorry to butt in, but
post that on the couples forum or something.

802
00:49:05,449 --> 00:49:07,239
Your time here is over, isn't it?

803
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:10,565
We don't have the time to listen to you brag.

804
00:49:10,565 --> 00:49:14,260
You should go away before this thread gets 1000 replies.

805
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:17,830
Huh?  Is it just me,
or is everyone kind of cold?

806
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,864
Densha, listen up.

807
00:49:19,864 --> 00:49:21,860
You're not single anymore.

808
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,972
In other words,
it's time for you to graduate from this thread.

809
00:49:23,972 --> 00:49:26,783
We've decided not to look after you anymore.

810
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:29,508
It's a shame, but it's time to part our ways.

811
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:32,749
But I don't want to be separated from you guys.

812
00:49:32,749 --> 00:49:35,447
I'll show up from time to time.

813
00:49:35,447 --> 00:49:38,467
So...  Please don't be so cold to me.

814
00:49:38,467 --> 00:49:39,917
I don't want to listen to your whining.

815
00:49:39,917 --> 00:49:42,040
It's only bothersome if you're here any longer.

816
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:49,678
This thread is limited to bachelors.
You have no place here anymore.

817
00:49:49,678 --> 00:49:51,733
Why?

818
00:49:51,733 --> 00:49:55,728
I thought we'd all become a group...

819
00:49:55,728 --> 00:49:58,995
That's so sad.

820
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:01,518
Don't you realize that we're telling you this
-because- we're your friends?

821
00:50:01,518 --> 00:50:03,501
You must take a new step forward.

822
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:04,900
You're not alone anymore!

823
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:05,938
Be strong!

824
00:50:05,938 --> 00:50:08,771
If you don't protect her,
Who's gonna protect Hermes?

825
00:50:46,652 --> 00:50:50,129
Okay, I understand.

826
00:50:50,129 --> 00:51:02,839
I'll depart.

827
00:51:02,839 --> 00:51:04,049
Well said, Densha.

828
00:51:04,049 --> 00:51:05,865
You'll be fine without us.

829
00:51:05,865 --> 00:51:08,552
Let's give him a warm farewell with the
remaining 300 posts we have.

830
00:51:08,552 --> 00:51:11,540
Everybody...
Tell him how you feel!

831
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:16,646
It's a bachelor graduation ceremony!

832
00:51:16,646 --> 00:51:18,093
Densha, watching you,
I realized something.

833
00:51:18,093 --> 00:51:20,404
I can't always be at the sidelines.

834
00:51:20,404 --> 00:51:21,675
I'm gonna step up to the field

835
00:51:21,675 --> 00:51:24,155
and have a relationship that everyone will envy!

836
00:51:24,155 --> 00:51:26,713
You guys...  Venoa~!

837
00:51:26,713 --> 00:51:28,832
I'm always soft on Hermes...

838
00:51:28,832 --> 00:51:31,572
But today, Densha was my hero!

839
00:51:31,572 --> 00:51:33,304
I'm not gonna lose to you.

840
00:51:33,304 --> 00:51:35,382
I'll throw away these loose socks...
(loose socks = socks worn by Japanese HS girls)

841
00:51:35,382 --> 00:51:36,601
...and work on a pantyhose fetish!

842
00:51:36,601 --> 00:51:38,876
Last stop.  Last stop.

843
00:51:38,876 --> 00:51:40,971
Best wishes for Densha and Hermes.

844
00:51:40,971 --> 00:51:43,209
I'm gonna keep hard at my day job.

845
00:51:43,209 --> 00:51:49,278
From platform 2,
the train bound for happiness is departing.

846
00:51:49,278 --> 00:51:55,925
Hey, we only have 200 replies left.

847
00:51:55,925 --> 00:51:59,230
"Densha, you taught us that
men aren't just about their outward looks.

848
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:01,033
You're definitely for real."

849
00:52:01,033 --> 00:52:03,312
Okay, so that was just a test.

850
00:52:03,312 --> 00:52:04,417
Thanks.

851
00:52:04,417 --> 00:52:08,012
The reason why the jumbo jet carrying
the two was able to take off

852
00:52:08,012 --> 00:52:11,166
was that you guys were always there
to refuel and maintain the plane.

853
00:52:11,166 --> 00:52:14,178
I'm really glad I found this thread.

854
00:52:14,178 --> 00:52:17,061
I felt drawn to your straightfoward personality

855
00:52:17,061 --> 00:52:18,746
and cheered you on.

856
00:52:18,746 --> 00:52:19,896
Young man,

857
00:52:19,896 --> 00:52:22,163
enjoy life to its fullest!

858
00:52:22,163 --> 00:52:24,900
Even I can help Hermes from a drunk.

859
00:52:25,152 --> 00:52:26,096
But...

860
00:52:26,096 --> 00:52:28,960
You're the only one for Hermes!

861
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,225
It's not a miracle.

862
00:52:30,225 --> 00:52:33,964
You got through to her
with your own strength!

863
00:52:33,964 --> 00:52:37,896
Just go to the couples forum.

864
00:52:37,896 --> 00:52:40,275
I'll be encouraged the most

865
00:52:40,275 --> 00:52:42,932
if you never have to come here again.

866
00:52:42,932 --> 00:52:45,743
Heh, this is out of character for me.

867
00:52:45,743 --> 00:52:47,400
I hate Densha!

868
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,577
and...

869
00:52:48,577 --> 00:52:51,786
I hate myself even more for wishing for...

870
00:52:51,786 --> 00:52:52,939
your happiness from the bottom of my heart!

871
00:52:52,939 --> 00:52:55,283
Shoot, we're down to 100.
Too soon, too soon!

872
00:52:55,283 --> 00:52:58,633
I guess everyone here wants to thank Densha.

873
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:01,108
Say it to your heart's content!

874
00:53:01,108 --> 00:53:02,528
Good job, Densha.

875
00:53:02,528 --> 00:53:04,349
I neglected my studies to cheer you on

876
00:53:04,349 --> 00:53:06,873
which makes me depressed
to think about myself from now on.

877
00:53:06,873 --> 00:53:08,780
But I think these 3 months

878
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:11,358
gave me something important in return.

879
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:12,569
I'm gonna get into college

880
00:53:12,569 --> 00:53:14,838
and enjoy the campus life there too.

881
00:53:14,838 --> 00:53:18,362
I love Densha and everyone else!

882
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:20,752
Me too.

883
00:53:20,752 --> 00:53:22,907
I really

884
00:53:22,907 --> 00:53:24,516
love you guys.

885
00:53:24,516 --> 00:53:27,523
People have called me a slacker or a moocher

886
00:53:27,523 --> 00:53:30,669
But for the first time,
I felt really involved in something

887
00:53:30,669 --> 00:53:34,707
it's a landmark not only for Densha,
but also for me.

888
00:53:34,707 --> 00:53:39,352
Well, that's a bit extreme,
but let's leave it at that.

889
00:53:39,352 --> 00:53:42,248
These 3 months I spent with you all

890
00:53:42,248 --> 00:53:44,109
It was loads of fun!

891
00:53:44,109 --> 00:53:45,602
All hands, disarm yourselves!

892
00:53:45,602 --> 00:53:47,702
Communications officer of the
8th youth infantry of the Yamada army

893
00:53:47,702 --> 00:53:49,431
will now return to the base.

894
00:53:49,431 --> 00:53:51,198
I'd like to share my appreciation
for having survived

895
00:53:51,198 --> 00:53:54,252
with everyone here today.

896
00:53:54,252 --> 00:53:59,387
Salute Densha!

897
00:53:59,387 --> 00:54:00,215
Densha

898
00:54:00,215 --> 00:54:02,622
I'm sure we'll see each other
on this thread again, right?

899
00:54:02,622 --> 00:54:04,693
Then, I'll bet

900
00:54:04,693 --> 00:54:07,912
you'll be coaching someone unsure of himself
like you youself were in the beginning.

901
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:09,680
I'm not saying good bye.

902
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,398
See you later, Densha.

903
00:54:11,398 --> 00:54:12,683
And to all my comrades!

904
00:54:12,683 --> 00:54:16,535
I really liked your personality.

905
00:54:16,535 --> 00:54:18,801
I like how pure and straightfoward you are.

906
00:54:18,801 --> 00:54:20,117
And more than anything

907
00:54:20,117 --> 00:54:24,772
I like how much you care for Hermes.

908
00:54:24,772 --> 00:54:30,061
I can't keep up with him
But I want to take care of my girl too.

909
00:54:33,509 --> 00:54:35,166
After getting to know Densha

910
00:54:35,166 --> 00:54:38,560
I really understood that guys
aren't just about looks.

911
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,847
My guy is pretty lame

912
00:54:40,847 --> 00:54:43,123
but he's a really warm-hearted person.

913
00:54:43,123 --> 00:54:47,030
I realized that after we were
cheering you on together.

914
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:50,322
I'm really grateful for that.

915
00:54:50,322 --> 00:54:52,645
Me too.

916
00:54:52,645 --> 00:54:54,422
I'm really grateful...

917
00:54:54,422 --> 00:54:56,266
Something really trivial started this off

918
00:54:56,266 --> 00:55:00,183
but with lots of courage
and a little minding of others' business

919
00:55:00,183 --> 00:55:03,259
and your hard work and growth

920
00:55:03,259 --> 00:55:05,705
must've brought forth this miracle.

921
00:55:05,705 --> 00:55:10,729
You take care of her forever,
you hear?

922
00:55:10,729 --> 00:55:12,645
Thanks to you,

923
00:55:12,645 --> 00:55:15,798
I found myself back in a relationship
I had given up on.

924
00:55:15,798 --> 00:55:17,306
Thanks for everything.

925
00:55:17,306 --> 00:55:20,727
I guess this is good-bye.

926
00:55:20,727 --> 00:55:22,666
I have to admit,
after I started to root for you

927
00:55:22,666 --> 00:55:25,733
I started liking you.

928
00:55:25,733 --> 00:55:31,031
I wouldn't have minded being
the first to sleep with you, you know.

929
00:55:31,031 --> 00:55:33,014
The details please

930
00:55:33,014 --> 00:55:34,589
on Densha and Hermes's future!

931
00:55:34,589 --> 00:55:37,608
It'll be lonely after parting with you!

932
00:55:37,608 --> 00:55:40,317
With hopes that I'll see you somewhere...

933
00:55:40,317 --> 00:55:44,184
Towards a new day...
I'm off.

934
00:55:44,184 --> 00:55:46,005
While watching over you two

935
00:55:46,005 --> 00:55:48,073
a lot happened to me as well.

936
00:55:48,073 --> 00:55:50,129
The most important thing

937
00:55:50,129 --> 00:55:51,270
was that I got married.

938
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:52,842
And thanks to you,

939
00:55:52,842 --> 00:55:56,307
my feelings for my wife really grew.

940
00:55:56,307 --> 00:55:57,797
I'm really grateful.

941
00:55:57,797 --> 00:55:59,016
My meeting you

942
00:55:59,016 --> 00:56:01,320
is my pride and joy.

943
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,632
Everyone too...

944
00:56:04,632 --> 00:56:06,616
You're my...

945
00:56:06,616 --> 00:56:07,995
Pride and joy.

946
00:56:07,995 --> 00:56:09,958
When I read Densha's report

947
00:56:09,958 --> 00:56:13,444
I was glad that I set up this thread.

948
00:56:13,444 --> 00:56:16,701
Not because it's the first time
a couple was formed

949
00:56:16,701 --> 00:56:21,931
but, because I think you
brought smiles to a lot of faces.

950
00:56:21,931 --> 00:56:23,700
Densha

951
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:26,774
You guys

952
00:56:26,774 --> 00:56:29,165
Good work.

953
00:56:29,165 --> 00:56:32,139
These 3 months were really something.

954
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:36,791
More than my regular life
the time here felt more real.

955
00:56:36,791 --> 00:56:40,508
I guess as life goes on, memories fade

956
00:56:40,508 --> 00:56:43,976
And this thread will disappear someday...

957
00:56:43,976 --> 00:56:47,430
But I don't want to forget what happened here today.

958
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:50,794
Real life has all these messy problems...

959
00:56:50,794 --> 00:56:52,891
but I guess there's some good too.

960
00:56:52,891 --> 00:56:55,847
I think my time here made me realize that.

961
00:56:55,847 --> 00:56:58,902
Some day, I want to see
what you're seeing

962
00:56:58,902 --> 00:57:02,406
So I'm gonna walk forward
on my own terms.

963
00:57:02,406 --> 00:57:10,263
So in the meantime,
you guys can show off to the couples forum!

964
00:57:15,254 --> 00:57:17,374
I dropped out for a while

965
00:57:17,374 --> 00:57:20,829
but I managed to see things
through to the very end.

966
00:57:20,829 --> 00:57:23,657
You couldn't tell left from right at first

967
00:57:23,657 --> 00:57:24,651
but thanks to everyone

968
00:57:24,651 --> 00:57:26,027
but you're graduating now

969
00:57:26,027 --> 00:57:28,351
as a true man.

970
00:57:28,351 --> 00:57:29,843
Densha

971
00:57:29,843 --> 00:57:31,882
don't let go of her hand.

972
00:57:31,882 --> 00:57:33,930
No matter what happens.

973
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:35,243
From this day on

974
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:37,443
you'll experience a lot of things.

975
00:57:37,443 --> 00:57:41,158
When things aren't going well,
remember this place.

976
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:42,739
What you've been doing...

977
00:57:42,739 --> 00:57:44,583
What you've been told...

978
00:57:44,583 --> 00:57:46,734
and, how you felt

979
00:57:46,734 --> 00:57:49,896
facing Hermes through everything.

980
00:57:49,896 --> 00:57:52,357
Best wishes for you two.

981
00:57:52,357 --> 00:57:55,132
And to everyone here...

982
00:57:55,132 --> 00:57:59,291
Thanks for the precious moments.

983
00:57:59,291 --> 00:58:00,440
Damn...

984
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,702
Shoot.

985
00:58:02,702 --> 00:58:08,689
I can't stop crying...

986
00:58:16,003 --> 00:58:17,742
You guys

987
00:58:17,742 --> 00:58:22,073
Thank you so much.

988
00:58:22,073 --> 00:58:23,338
I'm so happy

989
00:58:23,338 --> 00:58:24,712
and feel so courageous

990
00:58:24,712 --> 00:58:26,986
and so grateful.

991
00:58:26,986 --> 00:58:33,309
All these feelings are coming out
in the tears I'm shedding.

992
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:41,079
I'll never forget you guys.

993
00:58:41,079 --> 00:58:44,296
Guys...

994
00:58:44,296 --> 00:58:45,816
I love you!

995
00:58:45,816 --> 00:58:50,459
I love you too man!

996
00:58:50,459 --> 00:58:54,009
Now, I can rest in peace.

997
00:58:54,009 --> 00:58:56,469
I'm crying more than a real graduation!

998
00:58:56,469 --> 00:58:59,097
Everyone get ready - 50 to go!

999
00:58:59,097 --> 00:59:01,874
I guess there'll be no new Densha thread.

1000
00:59:01,874 --> 00:59:04,643
This heartache...  It's so painful...

1001
00:59:04,643 --> 00:59:07,627
What am I gonna look forward to
from tomorrow on!?

Let us know when you get married.
To your everlasting happiness.

1003
00:59:11,201 --> 00:59:16,703
Let's stop posting here.
That way, we'll always be with Densha.

1004
00:59:16,703 --> 00:59:20,012
...yeah, I know that's not gonna happen...

1005
00:59:20,012 --> 00:59:22,762
I'm glad I won't have to hear
how affectionate you two are.

1006
00:59:22,762 --> 00:59:26,649
965.  In the end, Densha was our hope.

1007
00:59:26,649 --> 00:59:33,274
966. Densha...  I love you man!
Don't go!

1008
00:59:33,274 --> 00:59:37,086
967. The thread is almost over!

1009
00:59:37,086 --> 00:59:42,436
968.  No more Densha from now on.
I don't want that!

1010
00:59:42,436 --> 00:59:48,491
969. Why, for someone I don't even know

1011
00:59:48,491 --> 00:59:50,023
am I crying so much?

1012
00:59:50,023 --> 00:59:55,097
970. Soon, days without Densha will begin.

1013
00:59:55,097 --> 01:00:01,418
971. I'm getting choked up over
how much you guys care for Densha.

1014
01:00:01,418 --> 01:00:02,123
Densha is a really lucky guy.

1015
01:00:02,123 --> 01:00:09,975
972. Densha, you fill in the 1000th reply.

1016
01:00:09,975 --> 01:00:18,436
980. I can post the 1000th reply?

1017
01:00:18,436 --> 01:00:24,864
982. Densha, in the end...
Please send us a message!

1018
01:00:24,864 --> 01:00:31,912
984. It's time to say goodbye.
I can't even see what I'm typing...

1019
01:00:31,912 --> 01:00:40,108
985. I figured out what I'm gonna write.

1020
01:00:40,108 --> 01:00:42,068
These thoughts...

1021
01:00:42,068 --> 01:00:43,774
I've had all along.

1022
01:00:43,774 --> 01:00:48,012
986. I'm curious, but I don't want to read it!

1023
01:00:48,012 --> 01:00:53,856
987. ...because that'll be
the last we see of him!

1024
01:00:53,856 --> 01:00:57,960
990. Farewell, my friend!

1025
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:02,991
991. I guess this is time...

1026
01:01:02,991 --> 01:01:07,408
992. Everyone, Densha...
I wish you well!

1027
01:01:07,408 --> 01:01:11,106
993. Everyone's too kind.
I was really moved!

1028
01:01:11,106 --> 01:01:17,507
994. Last post.
Densha, see you again somewhere.

1029
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:21,169
995. Don't forget about us!

1030
01:01:21,169 --> 01:01:26,005
996. I guess this is...  the end...

1031
01:01:26,005 --> 01:01:33,877
997. If I get post 999 I'd confess
to someone too...if I had someone.

1032
01:01:33,877 --> 01:01:45,833
998. The departing whistle
is about to be blown!

1033
01:01:45,833 --> 01:01:47,642
Happy...

it's because of these people

1040

that we got together, right?

01:04:06,616 --> 01:04:09,266
Yeah.

I guess I go out
and buy a few things...

1045
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:54,660
Going out?

1046
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:55,378
Yep.

1047
01:06:55,378 --> 01:06:59,671
I'm going out with Tsuyoshi-san.

You're looking bright and cheerful.

You too, mother.

1051

See you later!

1052
01:07:08,757 --> 01:07:09,540

You hanging in there?

1058

This is called a restaurant,
but we only serve coffee, dumbass.

1059
01:07:30,881 --> 01:07:33,618
Then I'll have one.

Hey

did she make a victim out of you, too?

1070
01:07:58,515 --> 01:07:59,706
Victim?

1071
01:07:59,706 --> 01:08:02,330
You too?

Not just me.

I spent so much money on her...

1077
01:08:15,912 --> 01:08:18,450
My boss was into her too

1078
01:08:18,450 --> 01:08:20,800
Thanks to that, I fell off my career track!
