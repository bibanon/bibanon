1
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:13,520
"Gimme" is back!

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,647
I'm going to Akiba with Hermes!
(Akiba is slang for Akihabara)

3
00:00:16,647 --> 00:00:18,014
What??

4
00:00:18,014 --> 00:00:21,018
Akiba?  You mean, the otaku fortress, Akihabara?

5
00:00:21,018 --> 00:00:22,253
Filled with guys like this, guys like that, guys like these...

6
00:00:22,253 --> 00:00:23,477
And guys like those and guys like these...

7
00:00:23,477 --> 00:00:25,411
and guys like this...

8
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:27,046
THAT Akihabara??

9
00:00:27,046 --> 00:00:28,715
Like, that's going a bit overboard on the 'coming out,' isn't it?

10
00:00:28,715 --> 00:00:31,662
Please give me the details  In Japan!

11
00:00:31,662 --> 00:00:34,143
Okay, well let me quickly explain what Hermes and I talked about

12
00:00:34,143 --> 00:00:35,866
No!  Take your time!

13
00:00:35,866 --> 00:00:39,572
For us, everything about dealing with women is completely new!

14
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:42,828
C'mon, kill us slowly and toy with us!

15
00:00:42,828 --> 00:00:46,750
Okay...  I'll explain everything...  From start to finish.

16
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,943
Um  Do you remember your promise?

17
00:00:49,943 --> 00:00:51,229
P  Promise?

18
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:53,293
I guess you forgot...

19
00:00:53,293 --> 00:00:55,567
Uh, no  I mean

20
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:59,114
The Com -pu-ter!

21
00:00:59,114 --> 00:01:01,566
I guess you did forget.

22
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:02,925
I'm so sorry!

23
00:01:02,925 --> 00:01:04,243
Then, as your punishment

24
00:01:04,243 --> 00:01:06,221
next time...

25
00:01:06,221 --> 00:01:09,942
you have to help me find one.

26
00:01:09,942 --> 00:01:10,834
Yes!

27
00:01:10,834 --> 00:01:13,236
What the heck  He's in Happy Mode all the sudden

28
00:01:13,236 --> 00:01:15,455
Oh man, a pouty Hermes...  Moe...
(see notes regarding 'Moe')

29
00:01:15,455 --> 00:01:18,109
Until now, I was backing up Densha, but I  I

30
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:19,135
The medic!  GET THE MEDIC!!

31
00:01:19,135 --> 00:01:23,156
No...  There's no pulse...

32
00:01:23,156 --> 00:01:25,733
What are you going to use your PC for?

33
00:01:25,733 --> 00:01:28,336
As long as I can surf the net and check my e-mail, it's okay

34
00:01:28,336 --> 00:01:30,779
Okay, so a more user-friendly machine

35
00:01:30,779 --> 00:01:33,282
Yamada-san, where do you usually buy them?

36
00:01:33,282 --> 00:01:36,286
Usually I go to Akiba...

37
00:01:36,286 --> 00:01:38,311
Uh...  I mean, Akihabara.

38
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:39,812
Okay, let's go there

39
00:01:39,812 --> 00:01:42,082
Um, but, if you don't care too much...

40
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:42,967
any electronics store will do...

41
00:01:42,967 --> 00:01:45,810
Yamada-san, I want to go where you usually go to.

42
00:01:46,937 --> 00:01:54,880
I want to get to know you better.

43
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,233
It's an air raid!
Quick, to the bomb shelter!

44
00:01:58,233 --> 00:01:59,970
It's too late for me.

45
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,389
See you on the other side...

46
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:05,402
The conversations I dream of when I'm in bed...
You're having them in real life!

47
00:02:05,402 --> 00:02:06,823
So it's a date at Akihabara...

48
00:02:06,823 --> 00:02:10,271
Akiba is the best!!
(note - for Ameircan internet junkies, it's closer to "Akiba rox0rz!")

49
00:02:10,271 --> 00:02:13,424
Hermes is wearing a maid outfit in my head...

50
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,171
A maid outfit...

51
00:02:30,702 --> 00:02:33,415
Welcome home...

52
00:02:33,415 --> 00:02:35,215
...master.

53
00:02:35,215 --> 00:02:39,149
No...  No!
You can't have a Hermes that cute!

54
00:02:39,149 --> 00:02:41,703
Want me to take you to a good hospital?

55
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,322
I bet she'll match Densha's otaku style...

56
00:02:43,322 --> 00:02:47,475
wearing a flower-pattern dress with a mid-length skirt...
...and two ponytails.  I'm sure of it!

57
00:02:53,932 --> 00:02:57,721
How do I look?

58
00:02:57,721 --> 00:03:02,418
Twin ponytails  Oh man...

59
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,454
I gotta Google a good PC for Aoyama-san.

60
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:09,382
Please!

61
00:03:09,382 --> 00:03:10,708
Yeeessss...

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,596

Thanks to those who spend time distributing this TV show,
and to Greyhorse for subbing episodes 1 through 8

64
00:03:31,472 --> 00:03:33,798
[Akihabara]

65
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:35,282
Um...

66
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,534
Yes?

67
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:38,936
Shall we hold hands?

68
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:43,686
You don't want to?

69
00:03:43,686 --> 00:03:45,454
With pleasure!

70
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:51,616
P...Please.

71
00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:22,818
I never really asked you what kind of PC you wanted...

72
00:04:22,818 --> 00:04:26,181
...it might not be of much help to you...

73
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:29,476
You researched all of this?

74
00:04:29,476 --> 00:04:30,717
Well...

75
00:04:30,717 --> 00:04:33,922
...there isn't much more I could've done for you.

76
00:04:33,922 --> 00:04:35,521
That's so nice of you -

77
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:37,401
thank you so much!

78
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:40,112
Don't mention it!

79
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:43,715
There are lots of people here wearing backpacks.

80
00:04:43,715 --> 00:04:47,247
Does everyone spend the night somewhere?

81
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:50,473
No, it's usually a day trip to Akihabara.

82
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:54,487
It's good that you found one that you liked.

83
00:04:54,487 --> 00:04:57,253
Thanks to you.

84
00:04:57,253 --> 00:04:59,907
No, you're too kind.

85
00:04:59,907 --> 00:05:01,350
Do you want to go to the 'Purikura' machines?
('Purikura' = those sticker picture machines, short for 'Print Club')

86
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,954
Over there.

87
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:07,381
A...a...photo w...with the two of us?

88
00:05:07,381 --> 00:05:08,558
Would you rather not?

89
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,628
No, I'd love t <bites tongue>

90
00:05:31,302 --> 00:05:32,534
These came out a bit funny...

91
00:05:32,534 --> 00:05:34,453
...but they make nice souvenirs.

92
00:05:34,453 --> 00:05:35,531
Th...thank you!

93
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,068
(I'll bet he was going for a shoryuken...)

94
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,368
Yamada-san, you're pretty good!

95
00:05:56,184 --> 00:05:57,532
(Not a DDR song!)

96
00:05:59,784 --> 00:06:03,532
Mr. Yamada!
(it's grammatically incorrect to directly address someone with a -shi suffix for reasons similar to why Americans don't address their 

97
00:06:03,532 --> 00:06:05,403
Hello.
(peers by putting a title before their friends' last names, but...)

98
00:06:05,403 --> 00:06:06,378
Mr. Matsunaga, since Aoyama-san is here...
(the writers for this program must've felt that it made good Otaku-talk)

99
00:06:06,378 --> 00:06:10,788
we should go Shibuya mode.
(Certain areas of Tokyo have their own youth cultures...)

100
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:13,102
Right.  Uhhh  Coincidence  it's so dangerous!
(but in most cases, it's a girl thing, like the typical Valley Girl...)

101
00:06:13,102 --> 00:06:14,659
No appointment  It's nothing! (bad Japanese pun)
(...and I'm almost certain that they aren't using real 'Shibuya-esque' language)

102
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,268
Guys, it's okay.

103
00:06:17,268 --> 00:06:19,263
Like, ohmigosh, I sooo don't know what you're talking about!

104
00:06:19,263 --> 00:06:21,028
That's like, so hilarious!

105
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:25,054
No...  You don't have to talk like that.

106
00:06:25,054 --> 00:06:27,546
Huh?

107
00:06:27,546 --> 00:06:28,769
Ohh I see, Mr. Yamada.

108
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:30,407
You spilled the beans on your otaku-ness!

109
00:06:30,407 --> 00:06:32,806
That's a giant leap forward for you, no?

110
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:33,508
B...but, Aoyama-san...

111
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:34,107
<here you go>

112
00:06:34,107 --> 00:06:35,703
are you okay hanging out...

113
00:06:35,703 --> 00:06:38,886
with a race like ourselves?

114
00:06:38,886 --> 00:06:41,404
Am I okay?  No, I'm having fun!

115
00:06:41,404 --> 00:06:42,695
She's such a good person!

116
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:44,637
She's about 23 levels higher than

117
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,376
the high school girls and office ladies who destroy us!

118
00:06:46,376 --> 00:06:48,147
Maybe about 15,000 exp?

119
00:06:48,147 --> 00:06:49,178
Level?

120
00:06:49,178 --> 00:06:51,942
Exp?

121
00:06:51,942 --> 00:06:56,799
Do all of you go to Akihabara a lot?

122
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:58,402
About 4 times a week.

123
00:06:58,402 --> 00:07:00,588
We look at girl games...
(Girl games = PC games, often for adults only, that get the player involved in virtual relationships with girls that are in such games)

124
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:02,573
...or anime girl figures.  We also go to events...
(Girl games = PC games, often for adults only, that get the player involved in virtual relationships with girls that are in the different games)

125
00:07:02,573 --> 00:07:03,482
Girl games?

126
00:07:03,482 --> 00:07:05,327
They're love simulation games.

127
00:07:05,327 --> 00:07:07,282
They're so...  Moeeee...

128
00:07:07,282 --> 00:07:10,961
Moe?

129
00:07:12,587 --> 00:07:15,065
Um, one more time, please!

130
00:07:15,065 --> 00:07:18,074
Moe-?

131
00:07:26,698 --> 00:07:27,905
This place

132
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:31,682
...is my own special spot.

133
00:07:31,682 --> 00:07:33,842
Really?

134
00:07:33,842 --> 00:07:36,945
Yes.

135
00:07:36,945 --> 00:07:41,291
You're the first person I've told this to.

136
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:47,283
I guess that means from now on, it's our special spot.

137
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:49,139
Yes!

138
00:07:55,678 --> 00:07:58,071
Wh...when I come up here, I feel a little more courageous.

139
00:07:58,071 --> 00:07:59,079
So I only come here...

140
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:03,983
...for special occasions.

141
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:08,837
So...  Is today a special day?

142
00:08:08,837 --> 00:08:11,533
Oh... No...

143
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:12,963
I didn't mean it like...

144
00:08:12,963 --> 00:08:15,457
Hey!  This is your chance to tell her!

145
00:08:15,457 --> 00:08:18,061
If you don't tell her now, when will you??

146
00:08:18,061 --> 00:08:21,617
I'll bet Hermes is just waiting for you to tell her.

147
00:08:21,617 --> 00:08:23,363
Uh...uhm...

148
00:08:23,363 --> 00:08:28,202
Yes?

149
00:08:28,202 --> 00:08:30,395
Uh...

150
00:08:30,395 --> 00:08:31,647
Oh...  I...

151
00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:35,091
I...  It's nothing.

152
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:41,201
I see.

153
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:47,874
Densha!  Are you really trying to become a 'couple' with her?
(this is another Gundam pun - 'Couple' typed as 'Capule' from Gundam ZZ)

154
00:08:47,874 --> 00:08:49,527
You've failed as a human being!

155
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:52,283
I did realize it was a chance.

156
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:54,924
But, it hasn't been too long since we made up...

157
00:08:54,924 --> 00:08:57,422
and if we were to start dating, how would I be?

158
00:08:57,422 --> 00:09:00,373
I worry about these things.

159
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,276
Don't be a chicken!

160
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:03,890
And you call yourself a Japanese guy!?

161
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,686
Have you forgotten your Japanese Spirit!?

162
00:09:05,686 --> 00:09:08,801
Well, Japanese Spirit has nothing to do with this, but just in case...

163
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:10,338
If you're seeing her often and you guys are clicking...

164
00:09:10,338 --> 00:09:12,575
What's the rush?

165
00:09:12,575 --> 00:09:15,699
Eventually, you won't be able to NOT confess your feelings for her.

166
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:17,374
Hey let's stop saying stuff that'll rush him, yeah?

167
00:09:17,374 --> 00:09:20,020
I have a feeling that Densha's own decisions will be more useful...

168
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,779
than ideas from a bunch of single guys.

169
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,967
Densha, you tell her when YOU feel it's right.

170
00:09:37,752 --> 00:09:39,861
Don't worry - no matter what happens...

171
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:43,831
Densha, I got your back.

172
00:09:43,831 --> 00:09:48,175
-pant pant-

173
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:49,614
W...what the...?

174
00:09:49,614 --> 00:09:51,239
Densha!  What happened!?

175
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:53,605
The Lord Densha has lost his bloody mind!

176
00:09:53,605 --> 00:09:54,710
Whose post is he panting about?

177
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,837
See?  You guys bugged him about confessing so much...

178
00:09:56,837 --> 00:09:58,455
He's gone mad!

179
00:09:58,455 --> 00:10:01,957
Densha!  Snap out of it!

180
00:10:01,957 --> 00:10:04,837
On my cell...  Hermes sent me a picture of her...  In her sleepwear!

181
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:12,628
You were all worked up over her picture!?

182
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:14,611
What kind of bombing is that?

183
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:16,572
How could you attack us like that when we're so defenseless?

184
00:10:16,572 --> 00:10:19,492
Her sleepwear  Are you talking about pajamas?  A negligee?

185
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:20,484
Pajamas.

186
00:10:20,484 --> 00:10:23,418
I feel so stupid for seriously worrying about you!

187
00:10:23,418 --> 00:10:25,833
Oh c'mon you idiot - confess to her!

188
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,722
She's rolling around the bed...

189
00:10:28,722 --> 00:10:30,262
She's so cute!

190
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:37,542
Shit, I've never wanted to see Hermes's face more than I do right now

191
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:39,679
So who are you guys thinking about?

192
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,034
Miki Nakatani for me!
(Miki Nakatani was Hermes in the movie version of Densha Otoko)

193
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:44,145
It has to be Mitsuko Baisho from a while back!

194
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:45,701
No way, it's Kumiko Ohba

195
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:48,056
Yuko Ogura, aka Yuko-rin

196
00:10:48,056 --> 00:10:49,622
I'll bet she's like Ryoko Kuninaka

197
00:10:49,622 --> 00:10:52,160
Oh c'mon, you think a hot chick like that is gonna have Densha within striking zone?

198
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,228
This is why Otakus' imaginations are so dumb

199
00:10:55,228 --> 00:10:57,938
But, more than any girl on TV...

200
00:10:57,938 --> 00:11:00,942
I like Hermes.

201
00:11:02,987 --> 00:11:07,940
This...is...ticking...me...off...

202
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,221
Densha  I don't know what you're thinking...

203
00:11:11,221 --> 00:11:14,431
...but Hermes still isn't yours.

204
00:11:15,057 --> 00:11:16,041
Well said.

205
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,988
So hurry up and make her yours!

206
00:11:17,988 --> 00:11:20,566
Don't forget that she still owes you for helping her out

207
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,494
Yep.  Maybe she's cornered in a spot where she can't say no to you even if she wanted to.

208
00:11:24,494 --> 00:11:27,013
And he's hit while he's on the ground!

209
00:11:27,013 --> 00:11:28,380
...yeah...

210
00:11:30,075 --> 00:11:34,513
You're right.  Sorry for acting all high and mighty.

211
00:11:34,513 --> 00:11:37,099
I really should know my place.

212
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:41,320
Next time, I'm going to help her set up her computer...

213
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,289
so I thought I'd tell her then, but...

214
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:47,288
...I guess not.

215
00:11:47,288 --> 00:11:49,743
Okay I'm out.  Good night everyone.

216
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:50,928
Wait!

217
00:11:50,928 --> 00:11:52,630
Wait!  What's this with her room!?

218
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,215
You have to mention juicy details like that first!

219
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,409
Don't throw away your plans to tell her!

220
00:11:57,409 --> 00:11:59,584
Hey, we're sorry about bullying on you like that!

221
00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:02,302
We were only kidding!  Tell us when you're going!

222
00:12:02,302 --> 00:12:03,422
Densha, don't go to sleep!

223
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:07,918
A response - give us a response! A response - give us a response! A response - give us a response!

224
00:12:07,918 --> 00:12:09,486
The Densha is currently unable to depart.
(if you haven't guessed, Densha means 'train' in Japanese)

225
00:12:10,912 --> 00:12:12,457
Over here please.

226
00:12:12,457 --> 00:12:15,470
Hello.
('Ojama shimasu' is what you say when you enter someone's house or apartment)

227
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,428
Mom

228
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:17,827
This is Yamada-san

229
00:12:17,827 --> 00:12:18,740
Come on in!

230
00:12:28,445 --> 00:12:29,641
Saori...

231
00:12:29,641 --> 00:12:31,417
Where's Yamada-san?

232
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,717
What are you talking about?

233
00:12:32,717 --> 00:12:35,449
This is Yamada-san.

234
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:37,424
Nninice to meet you  I...I'm Yamada.

235
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:46,075
Saori...

236
00:12:46,075 --> 00:12:48,328
You have your contacts on, right?

237
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:49,983
Yeah

238
00:12:49,983 --> 00:12:53,596
Okay...so is that a joke or something?

239
00:12:53,596 --> 00:12:57,283
He just seems like a weirdo to me.

240
00:12:57,283 --> 00:12:59,308
Mom, that's rude.

241
00:12:59,308 --> 00:13:01,794
But!

242
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:05,947
What a disappointment.

243
00:13:05,947 --> 00:13:06,940
N-nice mmeeting you.

244
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,126
Let's go up to my room.

245
00:13:12,772 --> 00:13:13,830
Hello?

246
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,632
Aoyama speaking.

247
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:25,108
Come on in.

248
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:26,170
This -

249
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,612
This is your room, Aoyama-san?

250
00:13:28,612 --> 00:13:31,739
Yes.

251
00:13:31,739 --> 00:13:33,560
Why don't you relax while I get some tea for us?

252
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,079
Sure.

253
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:46,599
Hey...

254
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:47,816
Yamada-san...

255
00:13:47,816 --> 00:13:49,959
...seems like a nice person.

256
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:52,129
Huh?  Mom?

257
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:56,255
His height is kind of adorable...
And if you squint at him, he doesn't look like he's not well-groomed.

258
00:13:56,255 --> 00:13:58,586
Well that's a change.

259
00:13:58,586 --> 00:13:59,588
Really?

260
00:14:00,729 --> 00:14:01,975
Hey, this Sunday -

261
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,908
Llet's go out on a family dinner with Yamada-san.

262
00:14:05,882 --> 00:14:09,707
What's wrong?  You're suddenly

263
00:14:09,707 --> 00:14:11,123
It smells so nice

264
00:14:23,544 --> 00:14:25,814
Is something wrong?

265
00:14:25,814 --> 00:14:28,632
Uh - no, it's nothing

266
00:14:28,632 --> 00:14:30,724
You've got a nice computer.

267
00:14:30,724 --> 00:14:32,019
Here you go.

268
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:33,508
Thank you.

269
00:14:33,508 --> 00:14:36,010
Do you need any help?

270
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,297
No it's okay, it won't take long.

271
00:14:38,297 --> 00:14:39,664
Please sit down.

272
00:14:39,664 --> 00:14:40,739
I see.

273
00:14:46,282 --> 00:14:48,552
It'sit's been so hot lately.

274
00:14:51,386 --> 00:14:54,962
Yes.  I'm not too fond of summer, actually.

275
00:14:56,539 --> 00:14:57,249
Oh I see.

276
00:14:57,249 --> 00:15:00,679
If I'm not wearing layers, I can't hide my physique so I don't like it.

277
00:15:01,506 --> 00:15:03,446
But, Aoyama-san, you're pretty skinny, so I don't think that's a problem.

278
00:15:03,446 --> 00:15:06,277
You...  You're saying I'm skinny...

279
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:14,643
My friends and my mom tell me that I don't look good because I'm so skinny.

280
00:15:14,643 --> 00:15:17,421
I see...

281
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:19,116
I guess the reason -

282
00:15:19,116 --> 00:15:20,816
I don't have a boyfriend is that my body is like this

283
00:15:23,745 --> 00:15:26,078
So... you don't have a boyfriend?

284
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:28,433
No

285
00:15:29,858 --> 00:15:31,011
A fiancee?

286
00:15:33,971 --> 00:15:38,715
She's available for sure!

287
00:15:38,715 --> 00:15:42,389
Free!

288
00:15:47,853 --> 00:15:49,606
Is everything all right?

289
00:15:49,606 --> 00:15:52,626
Uhyes.

290
00:15:52,626 --> 00:15:53,699
But...

291
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:55,184
Even if you're skinny or fat

292
00:15:55,184 --> 00:15:57,590
I think that's fine.

293
00:15:59,157 --> 00:16:02,692
It's just that other guys are blind.

294
00:16:12,202 --> 00:16:13,856
Please...

295
00:16:13,856 --> 00:16:16,627
Please don't lead me on like that.

296
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:31,117
Confess!

297
00:16:31,117 --> 00:16:34,012
Uhm...

298
00:16:34,012 --> 00:16:37,379
No, please go ahead.

299
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:41,295
Do you want to have dinner with my family this coming Sunday?

300
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:48,174
Dinner?
(shokuji means 'meal' if it's literally translated, but dinner is often implied with the use of this word)

301
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,244
Sure

302
00:16:49,244 --> 00:16:50,046
Okay

303
00:16:50,046 --> 00:16:52,247
I'll let you know when and where later on.

304
00:16:52,247 --> 00:16:54,275
All right.

305
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:05,659
W...with the family?

306
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:06,876
What am I gonna do?

307
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:09,263
It's dinner with Hermes's family!

308
00:17:09,263 --> 00:17:12,727
She told me that her dad won't be there, but...

309
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:16,103
...why did I agree to go?

310
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:18,105
This is what you get for leaving us for ourselves.

311
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:19,956
Ah, the rite of passage before you can confess to her

312
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:23,255
But if the dad's not there, you can set your sights just on Hermes's mom.

313
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:26,414
Keep in mind that the most important objective of this mission is to be liked by Hermes's mother.

314
00:17:26,414 --> 00:17:28,767
Rich ladies will definitely be on the lookout for your appearance!

315
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:31,511
She's not rich, but my mom doesn't like sloppy guys either.

316
00:17:31,511 --> 00:17:32,996
No thanks for the useless info!

317
00:17:32,996 --> 00:17:35,943
No thanks for the useless info!

318
00:17:35,943 --> 00:17:38,601
But you should definitely look nice - abesh!
(Fist of the North Star reference)

319
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:41,605
Can't just dress up casually like usual?

320
00:17:41,605 --> 00:17:44,317
A dinner with the family means you gotta suit up!

321
00:17:44,317 --> 00:17:45,417
Go with a tux.

322
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:48,528
Ask me anything about suits!
I can give you a 3 hour lecture.

323
00:17:48,528 --> 00:17:50,849
What else do you have to worry about...

324
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:53,324
You're fine on table manners right?

325
00:17:53,324 --> 00:17:56,848
Table manners?

326
00:17:56,848 --> 00:17:59,449
Brrr...  Shiver shiver shiver shiver shiver

327
00:17:59,449 --> 00:18:00,731
I guess you didn't know after all...

328
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:03,518
I'll bestow upon you my skills in
eating a banana gracefully

329
00:18:03,518 --> 00:18:05,490
It's also important to be a good talker at the dinner table.

330
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,374
Go to a self-improvement seminar!

331
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:08,832
Read a paper and be up on current events.

332
00:18:08,832 --> 00:18:11,420
So there's a new suit, table manners,
and dialogue on the list...

333
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,438
The way this conversation is headed,
it's about time we gave 'it' a try again.

334
00:18:14,438 --> 00:18:15,255
Densha Otoko
(Evangelion?  What's that?)

335
00:18:15,255 --> 00:18:16,904
Modification Plan
(Evangelion?  What's that?)

336
00:18:16,904 --> 00:18:23,405
part 2
(Evangelion?  What's that?)

337
00:18:23,405 --> 00:18:28,378
Um...  Where'd you buy that suit?

338
00:18:28,378 --> 00:18:31,775
With a suit, rather than getting what's trendy,
you have to be able to impress.

339
00:18:31,775 --> 00:18:37,752
It's better to look at people around you
rather than fashion magazines.

340
00:18:37,752 --> 00:18:38,590
Oikawa-san

341
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,576
Where did you buy that suit?

342
00:18:40,576 --> 00:18:42,240
Paris...  Milano...  New York...

343
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,522
Oh, this is a custom tailored suit I got in Milano.

344
00:18:45,522 --> 00:18:47,830
I can't compete with Oikawa-kun

345
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,573
but I have an Italian suit too.

346
00:18:49,573 --> 00:18:52,504
But I can't compete against Oikawa-kun.

347
00:18:52,504 --> 00:18:56,408
There are lots of well-dressed people
among your superiors at work.

348
00:18:58,934 --> 00:18:59,835
That's really true!

349
00:18:59,835 --> 00:19:00,628
Amazing!

350
00:19:00,628 --> 00:19:01,629
Of course.

351
00:19:01,629 --> 00:19:04,903
Japanese suits...  I can't get myself to wear them.

352
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:06,130
Yeah, I'd say so too.

353
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,480
And the logo...

354
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,681
Huh?

355
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:10,642
But this...

356
00:19:10,642 --> 00:19:12,352
This is made in Japan.
['Made in Italy' written in Japanese]

357
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:14,586
Yeah, well...  Um...

358
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,958
What?

359
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:23,015
Communication with Hermes's mother is key.

360
00:19:23,015 --> 00:19:26,519
But it's almost impossible for Densha to
get good at conversations.

361
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:28,584
Maybe you can try praising her?

362
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:35,745
Nobody dislikes being praised, you know.

363
00:19:35,745 --> 00:19:37,595
Be humble about it.
(Literal meaning = keep your back low)

364
00:19:43,251 --> 00:19:45,455
Hey what are you doing?
You're grossing me out!

365
00:19:45,455 --> 00:19:47,949
Jinkama-san,
you really have the sharpest tongue in Japan

366
00:19:47,949 --> 00:19:49,520
You trying to pick a fight with me?

367
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,862
Don't let that smile disappear from your face!

368
00:19:52,862 --> 00:19:54,071
That was a good one!

369
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:55,973
Your thick makeup makes you look young today!

370
00:19:55,973 --> 00:19:57,382
Shut the f_ck up!

371
00:19:57,382 --> 00:19:58,601
That was a good one!

372
00:19:58,601 --> 00:20:01,998
That aloof look on your face is beautiful!

373
00:20:01,998 --> 00:20:06,962
That was a good one!

374
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:08,560
death

375
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,510
I'm sure the other person will be smiling.

376
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,711
That felt great!

377
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,234
Last item: table manners

378
00:20:18,234 --> 00:20:19,367
Don't hold your knife upside down

379
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:21,803
And drink your soup silently lol

380
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,540
It's only manners
BUT they're important!

381
00:20:24,814 --> 00:20:27,923
Hey...  Are you sure about this?

382
00:20:27,923 --> 00:20:30,596
Yeah.
This is the only way I can get it on short notice.

383
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:35,824
Here goes.

384
00:20:35,824 --> 00:20:38,487
Start with the knife and fork on the outside.

385
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,072
Yes ma'am!

386
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,114
Whoa, what're you doing?

387
00:20:42,114 --> 00:20:44,085
Hey, could you take over?

388
00:20:44,085 --> 00:20:46,532
Can you push this button as soon as
he makes a mistake?

389
00:20:46,532 --> 00:20:47,748
Okay leave it up to me.

390
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:51,617
Get ready for some quality judging!

391
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,447
After eating...

392
00:20:53,447 --> 00:20:56,636
wipe your mouth with the napkin, and then...

393
00:20:56,636 --> 00:21:01,687
take a sip of your drink.

394
00:21:01,687 --> 00:21:05,077
Too long...
Too long!!

395
00:21:05,077 --> 00:21:06,247
What did I do wrong?

396
00:21:06,247 --> 00:21:08,687
No, no, your face.

397
00:21:08,687 --> 00:21:11,321
Yamada eating with Saori's family?

398
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:14,384
Yeah, but it's tough trying to find a good place...

399
00:21:14,384 --> 00:21:16,478
Saori - you bought a computer recently, right?

400
00:21:17,226 --> 00:21:18,653
Then you should look up a place on the 'net.

401
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,916
I didn't know you were into web surfing.

402
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,687
Hey, you ever hear of "Aladdin Channel?"

403
00:21:23,687 --> 00:21:25,247
"Aladdin Channel?"

404
00:21:25,247 --> 00:21:28,557
It's an anonymous BBS that's been talked about lately.

405
00:21:28,557 --> 00:21:30,784
Apparently they'll listen to any kind of problems you might have.

406
00:21:30,784 --> 00:21:32,335
Really?

407
00:21:32,335 --> 00:21:33,756
I thought Aladdin Channel was...

408
00:21:33,756 --> 00:21:36,932
a gathering place for Otakus,
where they talk smack on others

409
00:21:36,932 --> 00:21:39,470
and do lots of shady stuff.

410
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,571
For real?

411
00:21:41,571 --> 00:21:44,723
And I was going to ask some questions about guys...

412
00:21:44,723 --> 00:21:45,615
Saori

413
00:21:45,615 --> 00:21:48,133
My dad's acquaintance has a good restaurant

414
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:48,971
Really?

415
00:21:48,971 --> 00:21:50,328
Really.

Th...th...

419
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:13,776
Thank you for inviting me today.

420
00:22:13,776 --> 00:22:16,825
Relax, you can take it easy.

421
00:22:20,044 --> 00:22:21,302
Can I go home?

422
00:22:21,302 --> 00:22:22,538
No

423
00:22:22,538 --> 00:22:24,524
I need you to be here.

424
00:22:24,524 --> 00:22:26,674
But I have nothing to do with this dinner.

425
00:22:26,674 --> 00:22:29,988
Thank you for visiting our restaurant today.

426
00:22:29,988 --> 00:22:32,933
I have tonight's dinner listed under Kazuya Sakurai.

427
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:36,445
As Kazuya Sakurai asked...

428
00:22:36,445 --> 00:22:39,669
the entire restaurant is for you guys tonight.

429
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:40,814
That's so nice

430
00:22:40,814 --> 00:22:42,607
To have this restaurant all to ourselves.

431
00:22:42,607 --> 00:22:43,350
With pleasure

You

436
00:22:53,075 --> 00:22:55,004
Did you say my name 3 times or more?

00:22:55,004 --> 00:22:56,114
Yes

Yes!

Now it's time...
For the secret weapon!

You have to play his part.

470
00:24:51,052 --> 00:24:53,005
You sure I'm fit for this role?

471

Eh?

472
00:24:53,754 --> 00:24:54,554
You're fine.

You totally look like him.

474
00:24:56,156 --> 00:24:57,478
Don't worry.

475
00:24:57,478 --> 00:24:59,159
Go, Fake Tsuyoshi.

Hey wait!

Mother?

483
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:40,455
There's nothing to talk about if it's just me and him.

484
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,731
That's why I had you all join me.

485
00:25:42,731 --> 00:25:44,294
This is bullshit!

486
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:45,735
Why didn't you say anything?

487
00:25:45,735 --> 00:25:47,010
If I told you, you wouldn't have come!

488
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,855
Of course not!

489
00:25:48,855 --> 00:25:50,556
Yuki

490
00:25:50,556 --> 00:25:54,467
Did you bring it?

491
00:25:54,467 --> 00:25:57,665
Let's not talk about this over dinner.

492
00:25:57,665 --> 00:26:01,507
So you planning on running away like that again?

493
00:26:01,507 --> 00:26:06,581
Then I'll have to ask you to sign it here.

494
00:26:06,581 --> 00:26:10,576
Please, not here.

495
00:26:13,147 --> 00:26:16,551
Um...

496
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:18,943
Who are you?

497
00:26:18,943 --> 00:26:21,163
Huh?  Oh...  oh, oh, I'm, uh, I'm...

498
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:22,267
Tsuyoshi Yamada.

499
00:26:22,267 --> 00:26:23,714
My friend.

500
00:26:23,714 --> 00:26:27,296
I see.

501
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:29,357
I'm Saori's father.

502
00:26:29,357 --> 00:26:32,507
Huh?

503
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,152
Sorry, but...

504
00:26:34,152 --> 00:26:36,397
we have to have a talk as a family

505
00:26:36,397 --> 00:26:45,766
could you please leave?

506
00:26:45,766 --> 00:26:47,006
Okay, I'll go home.

507
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:48,801
I'm sorry.

508
00:26:48,801 --> 00:26:49,964
No, please.

509
00:26:53,438 --> 00:26:56,110
Thank you for everything today.

510
00:27:10,475 --> 00:27:11,716
Um...

511
00:27:11,716 --> 00:27:15,613
I have to go to my next gig...

512
00:27:15,613 --> 00:27:17,882
Good night.

513
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:43,718
You said

514
00:27:43,718 --> 00:27:45,105
...you wouldn't divorce...

515
00:27:46,644 --> 00:27:49,259
until after Keisuke graduated from college.

516
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:52,237
That's why I waited.

517
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:53,785
Let's get this over with.

518
00:27:58,127 --> 00:27:59,852
I have to run some errands after this

519
00:27:59,852 --> 00:28:00,946
can you please just hurry up?

520
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:02,514
Is she waiting for you or something?

521
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,949
This has nothing to do with you.

522
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:05,440
Mom just hurry up!

523
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,328
Keisuke can you please stay out of this?

524
00:28:06,328 --> 00:28:07,235
If you don't end it here you'll just get
all of us into deeper trouble.

525
00:28:07,235 --> 00:28:09,854
Look at sis.

526
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,872
Thanks to you and dad...

527
00:28:11,872 --> 00:28:13,801
she can't trust guys anymore.

528
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:15,968
Keisuke.

529
00:28:15,968 --> 00:28:18,514
Can't you keep us out of this?

530
00:28:18,514 --> 00:28:20,409
is that true, Saori?

531
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:21,903
What are you saying?

532
00:28:21,903 --> 00:28:22,987
You keep your mouth shut.

533
00:28:22,987 --> 00:28:25,748
Keisuke, stop!

534
00:28:25,748 --> 00:28:31,145
Uhh...

535
00:28:31,145 --> 00:28:37,585
I forgot something...

536
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:39,686
I'm outta here.

537
00:28:39,686 --> 00:28:43,051
Take whatever it is that you left here.

538
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:47,839
I'm sorry.

539
00:29:01,603 --> 00:29:04,231
Is there something else?

540
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:05,514
Oh, um, no.

541
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,646
I think that marriage...

542
00:29:34,646 --> 00:29:39,614
is an amazing thing.

543
00:29:39,614 --> 00:29:41,603
Just going out with someone

544
00:29:41,603 --> 00:29:46,292
is such a big deal for me...

545
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:48,001
but then

546
00:29:48,001 --> 00:29:50,279
you propose

547
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:53,738
meet each others' parents

548
00:29:53,738 --> 00:29:56,742
buy rings

549
00:29:56,742 --> 00:29:59,778
have a wedding

550
00:29:59,778 --> 00:30:01,938
it probably...

551
00:30:01,938 --> 00:30:06,660
probably requires a lot more courage
than you can imagine.

552
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,654
What are you trying to say?

553
00:30:07,654 --> 00:30:10,826
Let him talk!

554
00:30:10,826 --> 00:30:12,761
Well...  I...

555
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:14,504
I...

556
00:30:14,504 --> 00:30:22,376
I'm not sure what exactly I'm trying to say.

557
00:30:22,376 --> 00:30:25,500
But

558
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:31,656
I don't want to see Aoyama-san so sad.

559
00:30:31,656 --> 00:30:37,440
I too have a dad and a mom.

560
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,134
Unlike the two of you,

561
00:30:42,134 --> 00:30:45,737
My dad is no help at all

562
00:30:45,737 --> 00:30:51,460
and my mom is never home.

563
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,085
But

564
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:57,982
They're always smiling.

565
00:30:57,982 --> 00:30:59,699
Even for such little things

566
00:30:59,699 --> 00:31:03,832
they laugh so much.

567
00:31:03,832 --> 00:31:05,799
And that's why

568
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:14,968
I feel so safe, and I laugh with them too.

569
00:31:14,968 --> 00:31:16,901
Children...

570
00:31:16,901 --> 00:31:18,320
want their parents to be smiling.

571
00:31:21,043 --> 00:31:23,578
I'm sure

572
00:31:23,578 --> 00:31:26,023
More than anyone

573
00:31:26,023 --> 00:31:33,286
she wants her parents to be happy

574
00:31:33,286 --> 00:31:36,089
That's why

575
00:31:36,089 --> 00:31:40,935
she always wants you to be smiling.

576
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:49,536
I'm sorry

577
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:04,062
Here you are.

578
00:32:04,062 --> 00:32:05,896
The divorce papers.

579
00:32:05,896 --> 00:32:08,282
I signed everything.

580
00:32:08,282 --> 00:32:10,208
Yuki

581
00:32:12,494 --> 00:32:14,113
See you.

582
00:32:37,479 --> 00:32:42,808
Mom

583
00:32:42,808 --> 00:32:46,135
I think I'm starting to understand...

584
00:32:46,135 --> 00:32:51,734
...why you chose that person.

585
00:32:51,734 --> 00:32:52,843
Can we go?

586
00:32:58,507 --> 00:33:05,132
Saori.

587
00:33:05,132 --> 00:33:13,248
I'm sorry.

588
00:33:13,248 --> 00:33:20,295
Dad

589
00:33:20,295 --> 00:33:22,480
See you later.

590
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:49,442
You won...

591
00:33:49,442 --> 00:33:52,061
Densha Otoko.

592
00:33:56,637 --> 00:34:01,968
Um...

593
00:34:01,968 --> 00:34:02,918
Shall we

594
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:06,551
hold hands?

595
00:34:06,551 --> 00:34:11,772
Sure.

596
00:34:25,999 --> 00:34:28,109
...so that's all for today.

597
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:30,701
Great!  Densha, you're making me cry...

598
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,563
Is the Densha Mobile Suit a monster?
(yet another Gundam 0079 reference...  too good!)

599
00:34:32,563 --> 00:34:34,481
Our Modification Plan - useless!

600
00:34:34,481 --> 00:34:36,083
Anything is okay if the ending is good!

601
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:38,084
Looks like Hermes's mom likes you too

602
00:34:38,084 --> 00:34:39,325
Okay, we cleared this mission.

603
00:34:39,325 --> 00:34:40,748
No more weak spots left!

604
00:34:40,748 --> 00:34:41,666
Next time, the confession!!

605
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:42,998
Everyone's so excited now!

606
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:43,891
분위기 탔다고 하니,

607
00:34:43,891 --> 00:34:46,212
Speaking of which,
looks like this BBS has gotten lots of attention too!

608
00:34:46,212 --> 00:34:47,856
Now that you mention it,
we have a lot more members these days.

609
00:34:47,856 --> 00:34:50,438
People are designed to flock to interesting places.

610
00:34:50,438 --> 00:34:53,224
Oh yeah, there were some high school girls
talking about this thread in the train.

611
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:55,132
I was suprised that my friends knew about it.

612
00:34:55,132 --> 00:34:57,541
We're all on our way to fame for sure!

613
00:34:57,541 --> 00:34:59,992
Wait a minute,
if the party's gotten this big

614
00:34:59,992 --> 00:35:02,779
Hermes will find out about this sooner or later.

615
00:35:13,704 --> 00:35:16,216
There's a chance that Hermes's friends will find out

616
00:35:16,216 --> 00:35:18,137
<<Brr Brr Shiver Shiver>>

617
00:35:18,137 --> 00:35:20,664
What does Densha think?

618
00:35:20,664 --> 00:35:23,307
I don't see it as a problem...

619
00:35:23,307 --> 00:35:25,401
"as if you had a right to say that," he interjected.

620
00:35:25,401 --> 00:35:27,205
왜 그렇게 낙관적으로 생각할수있는거야?

621
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:29,146
How can you think so lightly?

622
00:35:29,146 --> 00:35:32,985
This board is packed with your thoughts and feelings!

623
00:35:32,985 --> 00:35:35,236
"It's started to smell good"
"Age = length of time withou a girlfriend"
Your peculiar mannerisms are all shown to the public

624
00:35:35,236 --> 00:35:36,588
"Where should I eat?"

625
00:35:36,588 --> 00:35:40,000
She'll know about all your questions like that too.

626
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,958
She'll find out about my Hermes obsession...

627
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:44,435
Who cares about us anonymous members?

628
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:47,964
Densha, she'll find out about all your panting too!

629
00:35:47,964 --> 00:35:49,809
Don't scare me like that.

630
00:35:49,809 --> 00:35:50,734
Hey Densha,
this is a pretty serious problem!

631
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:52,701
If this leaks out,
Hermes will be pretty upset!

632
00:35:52,701 --> 00:35:55,015
Even if it's Hermes,

633
00:35:55,015 --> 00:35:56,610
I don't think she'll forgive you

634
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,671
for spilling the beans on her so much.

635
00:35:57,671 --> 00:36:01,375
I'm a girl,

636
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:02,615
but if someone was talking about me
and I didn't know about it, I wouldn't like it.

637
00:36:02,615 --> 00:36:05,903
That's an honest opinion.

638
00:36:05,903 --> 00:36:08,151
Holding hands or a first date...

639
00:36:08,151 --> 00:36:10,984
I think a girl would want to keep that between the two of you

640
00:36:10,984 --> 00:36:14,203
Having my words written down like this...
WOULD FREAK ME OUT

641
00:36:14,203 --> 00:36:15,323
Llike the stalker!

642
00:36:15,323 --> 00:36:18,935
She thought that was between the two of you...

643
00:36:18,935 --> 00:36:22,249
she'll start crying if she knew you were telling us!

644
00:36:22,249 --> 00:36:25,901
Your mistakes or misunderstandings, like the surfing,
would be pretty sad to have exposed.

645
00:36:25,901 --> 00:36:28,862
Depending on your point of view...

646
00:36:28,862 --> 00:36:30,512
you've shared with everyone details of her private life.

647
00:36:30,512 --> 00:36:33,022
I thought about it after reading everyone's replies...

648
00:36:33,022 --> 00:36:36,141
but maybe this is a betrayal against Hermes.

649
00:36:36,141 --> 00:36:38,320
[Betrayal]

650
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,973
Betrayal...

651
00:36:40,973 --> 00:36:44,029
I didn't even think about that.

652
00:36:44,029 --> 00:36:47,863
I was betraying Hermes...

653
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:13,693
Well it's only a 'what if' scenario.
Don't dwell on it too much.

654
00:37:13,693 --> 00:37:16,775
But can we leave it at that?
No, we cant.

655
00:37:16,775 --> 00:37:19,193
It's better to tell her on your own before she finds out.

656
00:37:19,193 --> 00:37:22,593
If you feel bad about it,
you should pour out your guts to her!

657
00:37:22,593 --> 00:37:25,038
But if you tell her she'll get really pissed...

658
00:37:27,808 --> 00:37:31,044
There's less than a 1% chance that Hermes will find out!

659
00:37:31,044 --> 00:37:32,661
It's not betrayal as long as she doesn't find out.

660
00:37:32,661 --> 00:37:34,804
If you talk to her,
I'm sure she'll understand.

661
00:37:34,804 --> 00:37:38,118
If I were Hermes, I would, sex you, I mean, shun you!
('seikou' is most likely used to mean sex in this phrase)

662
00:37:38,118 --> 00:37:40,854
Hermes will get electrocuted from all the shock!

663
00:37:40,854 --> 00:37:42,365
If you expose this BBS,

664
00:37:42,365 --> 00:37:46,326
your chances of making it to the World Cup
go down the drain!

665
00:37:46,326 --> 00:37:47,718
This is the single-guys' association.

666
00:37:47,718 --> 00:37:49,494
Densha...
Respond immediately!

667
00:37:49,494 --> 00:37:52,358
Hey Densha!  You listening!?

668
00:38:13,664 --> 00:38:16,527
I tried everything...

669
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:20,970
but I don't think I can go back there.

670
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,532
Good bye...

671
00:38:22,532 --> 00:38:24,864
Densha.

672
00:38:24,864 --> 00:38:31,991
Ow!  Ouch!!

673
00:38:31,991 --> 00:38:33,292
Wait a minute...

674
00:38:33,292 --> 00:38:38,525
This part...  Was this the problem all along?

675
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:42,040
기다려라 전차

676
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,522
Wait for me...
Densha!

677
00:38:45,522 --> 00:38:52,563
Okay, gotta put this part here...

678
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:54,544
Hey what do you think you're doing?

679
00:38:54,544 --> 00:38:55,398
This is...

680
00:38:55,398 --> 00:38:56,597
No!

681
00:38:56,597 --> 00:38:57,801
What's going on?

682
00:38:57,801 --> 00:38:58,994
I really don't know what you're talking about

683
00:38:58,994 --> 00:39:02,577
Why is stuff about sis written on there??

684
00:39:02,577 --> 00:39:03,983
Did you do that?

685
00:39:03,983 --> 00:39:06,192
How could you say such a thing?

686
00:39:06,192 --> 00:39:08,338
...it must be him.

687
00:39:08,338 --> 00:39:10,921
Yamada wrote all that, right?

688
00:39:10,921 --> 00:39:12,907
I'll bet you hooked up with me because...

689
00:39:12,907 --> 00:39:14,258
you wanted to snoop around on sis!

690
00:39:14,258 --> 00:39:15,967
No, that's not true!

691
00:39:15,967 --> 00:39:18,529
So you were in this together...

692
00:39:18,529 --> 00:39:20,808
I can't believe this shit.

693
00:39:20,808 --> 00:39:22,133
Hey!

694
00:39:42,915 --> 00:39:46,089
Look, we're not trying to threaten you here.

695
00:39:46,089 --> 00:39:49,038
You'll only self-destruct if you tell her about this BBS.

696
00:39:49,038 --> 00:39:51,772
Densha, we're saying these things for your sake.

697
00:39:51,772 --> 00:39:54,079
I don't want to see you get hurt!

698
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,394
if you tell her it'll be over for sure!

699
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,110
Are you okay with flushing all your efforts down the toilet?

700
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:06,680
I don't care if we're single forever.

701
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,290
I don't care if we're made fun of.

702
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,591
But for you...

703
00:40:09,591 --> 00:40:11,152
we want things to go well.

704
00:40:11,152 --> 00:40:13,792
We're putting all our hopes on to you

705
00:40:13,792 --> 00:40:16,047
so just keep mum about this!

706
00:40:25,573 --> 00:40:27,467
It's up to you to decide

707
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:30,763
if you've betrayed her or not.

708
00:40:30,763 --> 00:40:32,106
But...

709
00:40:32,106 --> 00:40:33,506
you need to think about what this board meant to you

710
00:40:33,506 --> 00:40:35,945
and I want you to come up

711
00:40:35,945 --> 00:40:37,688
with your own answer.

712
00:40:37,688 --> 00:40:39,931
after giving this board a lot of thought, too.

713
00:41:15,653 --> 00:41:17,528
Your thoughts and feelings

714
00:41:17,528 --> 00:41:21,477
made me really happy.

715
00:41:21,477 --> 00:41:23,654
Thank you

716
00:41:23,654 --> 00:41:27,963
for worrying so much for me.

717
00:41:27,963 --> 00:41:30,872
However...

718
00:41:30,872 --> 00:41:42,000
I can't let things be.

719
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,097
Through this message board

720
00:41:44,097 --> 00:41:46,062
I've explained everything

721
00:41:46,062 --> 00:41:50,336
that happened between us.

722
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,469
and that...

723
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:54,683
what I did...

724
00:41:54,683 --> 00:42:00,050
for her, may be something terrible.

725
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,217
but!

726
00:42:02,217 --> 00:42:05,946
if I hadn't posted here

727
00:42:05,946 --> 00:42:08,280
I never would have made it

728
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,299
with Hermes.

729
00:42:13,256 --> 00:42:16,153
If I hadn't posted here

730
00:42:16,153 --> 00:42:17,843
I never...

731
00:42:17,843 --> 00:42:23,801
would have understood what it is...

732
00:42:23,801 --> 00:42:26,029
to be able to like myself.

733
00:42:26,029 --> 00:42:29,894
And more than anything,
I never would have...

734
00:42:29,894 --> 00:42:33,652
met so many wonderful friends.

735
00:42:33,652 --> 00:42:35,023
You guys...

736
00:42:35,023 --> 00:42:37,859
because you guys were always there for me

737
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:39,257
I...

738
00:42:39,257 --> 00:42:44,809
was able to make it this far.

739
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:48,582
This board...

740
00:42:48,582 --> 00:42:55,343
is something I'm proud of.

741
00:42:55,343 --> 00:42:56,955
So...

742
00:42:56,955 --> 00:42:58,622
right now...

743
00:42:58,622 --> 00:43:00,045
I'm going to...

744
00:43:00,045 --> 00:43:04,687
tell her about this board.

745
00:43:04,687 --> 00:43:07,713
My feelings...

746
00:43:07,713 --> 00:43:19,026
everybody's feelings...

747
00:43:19,026 --> 00:43:26,561
I want her to understand them...

748
00:43:26,561 --> 00:43:29,765
In conclusion...

749
00:43:29,765 --> 00:43:36,194
I'd like to say...
with feelings much stronger than words...

750
00:43:36,194 --> 00:43:38,460
Guys...

751
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,547
I'm sorry.

752
00:43:40,547 --> 00:43:42,761
...and

753
00:43:42,761 --> 00:43:55,856
thanks.

754
00:43:55,856 --> 00:43:56,859
What's wrong?

755
00:43:56,859 --> 00:43:58,617
What's with the scary look on your face?

756
00:43:58,617 --> 00:44:01,213
Sis, you were being tricked by that guy Yamada all along.

757
00:44:01,213 --> 00:44:02,083
What?

758
00:44:02,083 --> 00:44:03,381
That guy...

759
00:44:03,381 --> 00:44:09,628
he was talking about you on the internet!

760
00:44:09,628 --> 00:44:12,039
His encounter with you...
Your emotional problems...

761
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:15,451
He jokingly posted about everything to
everyone in Japan, and he was
making a fool out of you!

762
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:30,574
You're kidding...

763
00:44:30,574 --> 00:44:31,582
I can't...

764
00:44:31,582 --> 00:44:35,067
[-pant pant-]

765
00:44:35,067 --> 00:44:36,404

He betrayed you, sis.

Yes, there are 11 episodes of Densha Otoko!

Why was Jinkama surfing the web in a hotel room, anyway?
