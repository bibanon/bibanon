This story, along with [the corresponding TV drama](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT_WS-Z0fxhuYg0-FZN9UjA/feed) is one of the [[Culturally Important Treasures]] from the Internet.

"[Densha Otoko, or 'Train Man'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Densha_Otoko) is the name of a very popular book published in Japan in early 2005, which tells the true story of a nerdy guy who falls in love with a girl who he saved from a drunk on a train. This entire story takes place on a Japanese bulletin board system called [[2channel]], or 'ni-channel', particularly in a thread called 'Men Being Shot from Behind', where single men get together and gripe about being single.

In typical Japanese fashion, after the tremendous success of the book, both a movie version and a TV drama series were released. 'Densha Otoko' is really the "it" book of 2005 for Japan. It's a really great story and I hope that this translation helps you enjoy it, too."
