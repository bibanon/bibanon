Last week I convinced Britt to come with me to her mother's house. There I told her exactly what was going on, then showed her the bruises all over Britts body, and called Betty a huge cunt for leaking Britt's location to the fat cunt.

She showed no remorse and retorted, 

"It was her own damn fault!" 

I flipped out and took Britt home.

---

Britt also went with me to my parents house on Tuesday, and I acted in her defense as she nervously pleaded her case to my mother, brother, father and sister...

She handed a small part of the money she owed back to my father and promised to pay them back. My parents have respected my wishes and given her another chance. 

But my little sister made her cry when I was talking to my parents alone, chewing her out for all the shit I went through, and scolded her with words that I'd probably never could have bought myself to say to her.

Britt felt so bad about it she had an emotional outburst and cried herself to sleep that night.

---

Britt's told her friends what happened, but hasn't told them that she's living with me. Instead she told them that she's "staying with an old friend," warning them to stay away from her ex. 

I trust nothing will come of it. I mean, I left her ex trembling in a pool of his own blood the last time he saw me, so I'm pretty sure he won't want anything to do with her or her friends.

If he's got any brains at all, he wouldn't test my patience again, seeing as how last time I could and would have beaten him to death and/or roasted him alive.

I wish you guys could take away some kind of deeper meaning or moral, but I honestly can't think of any. This was all just some "Slice of Life" craziness I thought you guys would enjoy reading as much as I enjoyed living it... 

Still, if there's one thing you can take away from it all, it's that _showers are actually quite magical._

1. They clean you up.
2. They wash off evidence of asskickery/badassery and pizza sauce. 
3. They give you a much needed place and time to think about the important things in life.
4. They're actually kind of romantic and a bit of a teamwork builder if you share one, heheh.

I hope you found this to be a cool story. 'Cause I don't know about you guys, but all this typing has really made me sticky. 

I'm going to grab a nice hot shower.

I hope every time you take a shower, smoke a cigarette, eat a pizza or kick the shit out of a fat deadbeat you'll think of me.

It's been real awesome, so thanks for reading.

So until next time.

\- UncleDan,  
Shower man.

I would just like to say, this story was very entertaining and I'm glad I got to be a part of reading it. I got excited every time I knew I could check to see if you posted more of the story. 

I don't even care if this really didn't happen to you, it'd be really cool if all of this is a true story, but either way, 

I really enjoyed myself reading this and I thank you for taking time to write all of this and post it.

Good luck with Britt, I think you guys will do amazing in the future.

Now time to shower in tribute to Uncle Dan.
