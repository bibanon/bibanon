These are the folk stories of the internet, sometimes stretching into long, sprawling epics. They're pretty much books in themselves, and gripping reads at that.

### The Father and his Daughter

Tales about anons who discovered an orphan in a terrible situation, and with the unexpected encouragement of the legions of Anonymous, helped them back up to their feet. 

Two anons, inspired by the first, repeated that kindness again in their own lives. 

Those anons became more than kind strangers; they became their child's mentors and adopted fathers.

---

These are the stories that the Bibliotheca Anonoma considers our greatest treasures; for their heartwarming tale of a father and his daughter, and their immersive depiction of 4chan culture during the Civil War/Golden Age Era (2006-2008).

* **[[Damaged Goods]]** (2006-2007) - What happens when [[Anonymous]] decides to grow a heart and help a literally broken girl smile again? This is the story of a registered male nurse who posted to [[4chan]] about his newest patient, a triple amputee orphan. 
  * Believing that there was no way he could help her, he posted his story on /b/, hoping for some lulzy responses. Unexpectedly, Anonymous showed empathy in epic proportions, pressing the man to give the girl a shoulder to cry on and maybe even give her a home.
* **[[Blindmute Loli]]** (2007-2008) - A spiritual sequel to Damaged Goods, Blindmute Loli is about an American everyman who finds his life turned upside down after he saves, and later adopts an orphan from the street. 
  * The injustice he suffers and the struggles he goes though just to see his adopted daughter will make you laugh, and will make you cry. Nobody knows if it's real or not, but it's a good story nevertheless.
* **[[Romeo-san and Juliette]]** (2008) - Story taken from 4chan's /b/. Romeo-san, as he's called, has taken in a little girl that ran away from an abusive house. He decides that it is in his best interest that he adopt Juliette (sleepy-chan) 

### Feels Bad Man

Stories that will leave you crying.

* **[[Lee Won]]** - An anon from /r9k/ decides to start his own crappy rock band. They call themselves "The Korean Pop Robots 9000" after their star guitarist, Lee Won.
  * Hilarity ensues. And drama. And all those other emotions you see in a good band movie. It's a story definitely worth making a movie about.
* **[[Tramp Anon]]** - The recollections of an anon thrown out of his house as a youngster, left homeless in a cold and hungry world.
  * He faces tremendous pain and struggle in a vicious cycle of poverty, relying only on his will to survive. But one day, an immigrant girl decides to cut him some slack when no one else would, and bring him back to a normal life.
* **[[Cool Story Bro]]** - When an anon from /r9k/ opens his door one fine day, he sees a woman on her knees, begging him for help; one that betrayed his love, shattered his trust, and stole from his family. 
  * And despite the odds, Dan, conflicted between deep-seated hatred and lingering love, reluctantly gives a safe haven to a woman whose transgressions he once deemed "unforgivable".

### The Forbidden Fruit

Stories told of trials and tribulations, faced by those anons whose love is not only socially forbidden, but could result in the end of their lives.

## [[Something Awful]]

Stories gleaned right out of SA's paywall.

* **[[Sweet Home 1984]]** - A story of what happens when a man from 2011 wakes up in the year 1984, and is forced to seek help at his own childhood home. Due to a similar inception to RomeSweetRome, it was put into the subreddit /r/1984Sweet1984. (For some reason, this entire story was lost on Reddit and no references remain; we are still trying to find it...)

## [[Wikichan]]
