[[4chan]] is hands-down one of the most interesting and influential websites ever created. It functions as the wellspring of modern internet culture; the ultimate source for most the Internet's memes. It also works as a beacon of anonymity and honest (but not to goodness) discussion in a world that is ever more socially invasive.

The site influenced a new generation of major Internet figures and coders, continues to birth to memes that are now common staples on most major websites and even common speech, and cultivated a flock of loosely organized people led only by a common goal, known as [[Anonymous]].

This Chronicle is designed to create a serious, well sourced history book about this ephermeral community. As of now, it includes a summary of the site's history down to it's foundation in October 1, 2003 and an extensive [[4chan Timeline|4chan History Timeline]].

## Ages of 4chan

4chan's history can be divided into concurrent eras, like that of Japanese history. Each era was dominated by different immigrant groups from other websites, ranging from old Internet communities such as [[Something Awful]] and "sister" sites like [[YTMND]] to Net Neutrality, anti-censorship activists and casual, Internet-oblivious Facebook users.

Mind that the names of each age, while named considering the perceived posting quality of the era, is highly relative, and to some, the time period might not add up at all with the name.

---


* [[Prehistory|4chan - Prehistory]] _(1996-2003)_ - 4chan, in a way, was the result of Japanese Internet Culture and the Western Internet colliding. The background of the world that 4chan was started in, and was influenced by, was dominated by two closely related, extremely influencing sites on Japan and a handful of highly hostile, creative and retroactive American forums.
* [[Genesis|4chan - Genesis]] _(Oct 1 2003 - Jun 20 2004)_ - 4chan is founded, borne out of #raspberryheaven, bringing the unique experience of anonymous imageboards to the English language world. It instantly finds supporters in Something Awful's ADTRW board. 4chan inherits its traditions, and initial memes from 2channel, Something Awful, and the rest of the Internet and creates a powerful meme-based culture that stands out from the crowd, slowly surpassing it's predecessor.
* [[The Golden Age|4chan - The Golden Age]] _(Aug 2004 - Aug 2006)_ - The classic 4chan years. All the content considered foundational and classic was created during these years, 4channers had a very absurd approach towards things, which culminated in highly creative and silly content. While most of the original content has been forgotten by now, it remains the quintessence of everything 4chan. The Golden Age waned as /b/ began to grow in size disproportionately and became uncontrollable.
* [[/b/ day|4chan - The /b/ Day]] _(Aug 2006)_ - 4chan's growing popularity comes with massive social change caused by problematic subcultures, a new raid mentality, and romanticism for an idyllic depiction of /b/. These tensions culminate in the /b/day, a massive revolt by /b/tards cause by moot's enforcement of rules on /b/, culminating in /b/'s userbase splintering into many minor sites.
* [[The Shithole of The Internet|4chan - The Shithole of The Internet]] _(Sept 2006 - Jul 2007)_ - The growing size of the imageboard populations made 4chan culture spread to every corner of the Internet. These memes are quickly assimilated by the rising giants of the Internet like Youtube and MySpace, inspiring interest in the website that started it all. Reception is mixed: 4chan becomes the focal site of the Internet, but at the cost of having it's memes monetized and mangled through cultural appropriation by outsiders. Population sharply increases, and so does the amount of interesting events from the era. This culminates in what is now known as 4chan's Eternal September: The Newfag Summer.
* [[The Dark Age|4chan - The Dark Age]] _(Aug 2007 - Aug 2009)_ - The onset of the newfag summer was but the culmination of several growing pains 4chan was going through since it's foundation. It's generally regarded by 4channers to be the worst years of 4chan, specially 2008, when posting quality plummeted and moot was deep in debt. When Scientology takes down a ridiculous training video posted to Youtube, 4chan fights back in full force as [[Anonymous]] in [[Project Chanology]]. The attacks attain media attention and a new flock of users, interested in activism, arrive to the site. On an unprecedented course of action, /b/tards change tactics and turns from DDoSing and spamming into a full blown protest. What happened in Chanology would be a glimpse of the future role anonymous would have on the Internet, that of hacktivism. Some months after the protests died down, a video of a strangely tantalizing teenager appears on the web, dividing /b/'s population into two sides, one crowning her as their Queen and the other wanting nothing to be with her. 
* [[The Silver Age|4chan - The Silver Age]] _(Sept 2009 - Jun 2011)_ - The population of 4chan mellows out in aggressively but not in interventionism. The would devise many pranks and small hacks all around the Internet, including getting moot named as Time's Person of the Year on 2009 and raiding Jessi Slaughter and getting her to go to Good Morning America!
  * [[The Payback Era|The People's History of Anonymous#operation payback extended wikileaks]] - Anonymous gets right back in action in Operation Payback when Aiplex Software was found to have DDoSed torrent sites under orders of the MPAA. While they succeed in destroying the company, the [[Wikileaks]] scandal greatly lengthens the operation, and the [[Arab Spring]] forces perpetual mobilization. Anonymous has become a force to be reckoned with, but it's former home 4chan, suspicious of their new face, motives, and organization, has long since disowned them.
  * At this point, [[Anonymous]]'s history permanently divests itself of 4chan history, and it is treated as an independent community. It continues on [[The People's History of Anonymous]].
* [[Meme Faces - The Second Newfag Summer|4chan - Meme Faces]] _(Late 2011 - Early 2012)_ - The Internet as a whole began to enter a new era, one where everyone is connected and constantly exposed to it. Internet culture, no longer a thing for a bunch of kids that spend too much time at home in their computers, became exposed to the masses and became massively popular. The golden age for content agreggators, the extreme commercialization of Internet - and 4chan's - culture led to a massive loss in content quality, no longer produced only at 4chan, and a complete outrage on the eyes of 4channers. With the Internet as a whole changing structure, seeing a revitalized use by companies and the government. These where crucial years where it's changes would change the face of the Internet for all.
* [[The Reactionary Era|4chan - The Facebook Age]] _(2012 - 2014)_ With the Internet in the mainstream, 4chan saw its population change to a more relaxed people who preferred discussion and in house content rather than stepping in the toes of other websites. The change brought it's negative points, with people in general becoming much more sensible and incapable of ignoring things they didn't like - A completely radical attitude compared to the live and let live approach the Netizens have used since the early 90s. One of the greatest points of this age if perhaps the sheer amount of content created by 4channers.
  * [2014 Tumblr/4chan Raids](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/2014-tumblr-4chan-raids)
* **The Chanpocalypse** _(2014 - Present)_ - A series of crippling scandals rocks 4chan, and the rest of the internet; forcing public and legal pressure against 4chan mods; from the general public, the media, the FBI, even it's own anons. Will the mods be forced to declaw 4chan? Will anons fight to move elsewhere, once again? It's a major turning point in the great 4chan Chronicle.
  * [[The Quinnspiracy|4chan - The Quinnspiracy]] - Zoe Quinn's shocking scandals (involving Five Guys in the video game industry) rocks the internet; with 4chan and Reddit falsely accused of attacking her. The scandal has severe implications on the video game journalism industry, and even reveals a troubling insight into the power of forum moderators as gatekeepers of information. In response to accusations of raiding Zoe Quinn; 4chan’s /v/ and /pol/ , along with other websites (yes, le Reddit) launched a united front to protest the scandal, in a unique new way.
  * [[The Fappening|4chan - The Fappening]] - Some unknown, edgy hacker got ahold of nude photos of American Celebrity Jennifer Lawrence. Instead of keeping the illegal treasure to himself like any sane fapper would, he decided to post it to an anonymous, popular, public forum for the lulz; 4chan's /b/. As a result, the yellow journalist media starts shit-flinging against 4chan, and the site gets flooded with new lurkers; WebMDs, alleged JLaw advisors, and looky-loo fappers (who will find nothing but gore pics). 
  * [[The Crackdown|4chan - The Crackdown]] - During these two crises, anons begin to accuse 4chan mods of censoring the Gamergate threads. Wild conspiracy rumors spread, but after the legal repercussions of JLaw Shitstorm, Moot is forced to make a public announcement sticky on /v/ that they will begin to enforce the historic 2006 /b/-day policy of NO RAIDS, and NO PERSONAL INFO. Shitstorms ensue. Anons resolve to move to 8chan and 4chen; but just like Americans threatening to move to Canada, talk is cheap.

### Major Sources

Wikis and sites dedicated to Internet culture and 4chan.

* [[4chan History Timeline]] - Passed down from generation to generation, archived and lost on countless wikis, this is the famous timeline of 4chan's evolution through the years. The last one was maintained by a Redditor on the second [[Wikichan]], but it was lost with the site's downfall and saved out of chance.

If there’s one thing they excel at, it’s at archiving drama. They seem to roam the line between life and death nowadays.
* [[The LURKMOAR wiki]] - [Lurkmore](http://www.lurkmore.com/) - The first chan culture wiki. It was an effort to compile and explain the crescent amounts of memes and culture 4chan was creating on 2005. Its population slowly shifted to ED, and eventually fell into obscurity and obsoletion.

Special mention to [[Wikichan]]: it was by far the most popular and exhaustive compilation of 4chan information there was. However, as dedicated its userbase was, it was constantly DDoS’d, dropped by ISPs and hacked. It was known for not only compiling info on memes but also having an extensive list of 4chan user stories and creepypasta. On 2010 the admin decided to call it quits. Many attempts to restore the info on Wikichan where performed, but only partially successful.
