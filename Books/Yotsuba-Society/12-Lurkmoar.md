How to "lurk moar"

“Lurk moar” is the standard phrase said to many a newfag in the
chanverse who does not know ever a simplest or common chan meme or
tradition. This phrase has been said many times, but what is not told of
them is how to lurk more. Usually the person says that is to will reply
in a kneejerkish way “just lurk more”. Since human beings expect other
people to figure it out on their own since they’re lazy, we’re doing the
job for them. First, the real question we should ask is: “What is the
purpose of lurking more?”

The purpose of lurking more is for people to be familiar with the chan
board they want to be part of the community before actually posting.
With lurking they can be familiar with the various conventions,
in-jokes/memes, traditions the board have to offer, and manners. In
addition, it will allow the channer to see which threads are accepted
and which ones are not accepted. In addition, the purpose of lurking
more is for the newfag to gather resources of its own without having
people to get it for him or her.

Each chanboard has its own culture and traditions. In some primary
imageboards each board have its own traditions and culture with its
general chan culture of the chan. In this case some chan boards are open
and some are closed. Boards that are more open can be posted into with
limited lurking. Boards that are semi-closed will have to result in more
time in lurking to understand the subject and the general culture of the
boards. Boards that have a closed culture can take a significant time to
understand before posting, sometimes weeks.

It is to be said that 4chan’s /b/ under the reign of W.T. Snacks
popularity a person would have to lurk for at least six months in order
not to get hit with the mods random bans. That’s how closed /b/ was.
This was the same length of time a new Toshiaki has to lurk in any of
the Nijiura boards. To me it seems like those boards culture was closed
so much that it might as well put up a sign that says “oldfags only.”

The 6 rule.

The real question we should be asking is how much we should lurk moar. I
mean the initially lurking and such. Based on that Hantoshi-rom rule of
Nijiura, we will be implementing the six rule. Six hours, Six days, 6
weeks. (Not related to 9 hours, 9 persons, 9 doors). Six hours for open
boards, six days semi-closed boards, and six months for closed boards.

The second part of lurking more is simple. If you don’t know, don’t ask.
And if you can’t figure it out, you have to search of it on your own.
You’re expected to figure it out without asking for another channer on
the boards.

How to actually lurk more

First, check out the front page and read every thread that is available.
Make sure you pay attention to every post on the page. Take note of the
pictures. It’s much easier doing so by using the “open new tab” to view
each thread. Second, go the last page of a board and read every thread
that is out there. Then go to each page of the board and read the
threads there. Finally, do the same thing with each page until you reach
the front page. At the same time, follow the threads you like until they
expire or deleted.

Repeat until 6 hours, 6 days or 6 weeks. In that time, you would learn
the intricies of each board’s culture and conventions that you can
finally participate without being a clueless newfag.

Basically in short: Lurk, and if you still don’t understand or “get it”:
lurk moar.
