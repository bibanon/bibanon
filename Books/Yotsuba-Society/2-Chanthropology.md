What is Chanthropology?

The Western Imageboard Culture is the most underdocumented and
misdocumented subculture in the early 21st century. Most of the
misdocumentation and underdocumentation is a result of the mainstream
media and the mainstream either focusing on the controversial or
accentuating the controversial. Due to this misdocumentation and
underdocumentation the imageboard culture as a end result has been less
taken seriously as a meaningful subculture, with the exception of people
who know much about the culture and take it seriously. The MIT paper
while a bit lacking on the actual knowledge of the culture did coined
the term: Chanthropology.

Chanthroplogy is a combination of two words. First is ‘anthropology’, is
the study of human culture, history, and traditions. The second is
‘chan’ as in imageboard channels such as iichan, 4chan, 2chan, and to an
extent textboards such as (2ch). When these two words are combined,
Chanthropology is the study of culture, history, traditions of
imageboards and textboards.

Only very recently that people are studying imageboards on a scholarly
or a very serious level as a culture worth looking and examining. Most
of the culture has been documented by various wiki’s and mostly internet
blogs and websites. But the information is always incomplete for reasons
I’ve already mentioned. Even when studied seriously, many scholars have
little or prior knowledge or experience in the Imageboard Culture.

The only boards the mainstream actually cares about is 4chan’s /b/
itself. Many of their thoughts about 4chan are influenced by this
mindset. As an end result, they do not know the true diverse culture of
the chan’s. Imageboards are for all intents and purposes, the closest
thing to an electronic hivemind we can monitor and study. When we mean
electronic hivemind, we mean the mixture of anonymity and the high rate
of pure content, pictures, information, and knowledge that is posted and
reposted in various ways, that we can actually see the culture.

However, Chanthroplogy should be done primarily by or with channers.
Because channers have the prior knowledge of the memes, culture and
general history of the subculture. They know a lot about how their
topics (like anime, politics, video games, television) are related to
the imageboards. They know the common pictures that may seem ordinary to
a normal person but to a channer they represent a piece of the culture.
And every picture and catchphrase has a backstory behind it.

But here at Yotsuba Society want to do something more with
chanthropology. We want to do something that has been done in regular
anthroplogy: Applied Chanthroplogy. We want to take the lessons and
mistakes that we learned and observed in imageboards and apply it to the
future to solve those problems. That’s why Yotsuba Society is not just a
simple blog or front page, we want to create our own hivemend for people
to participate in develop. That’s why we not only created our own chan
(www.yschan.org) but a wiki as well (wiki.yotsubasociety.org). We want
to develop the imageboard culture in our own way, something that will
give people a real alternative to static forums, a place where all
people of all walks of life will have a home to go to.

Our goal with Chanthropology is to use it help study, preserve, and
develop the imageboard culture, for all people.
