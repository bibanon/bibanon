                    <--Every Phreaker Needs His Own-->



Some phreaks believe in the down-n-dirty customizing of equipment by 
crafting it themselves...not me !.  I believe that the other guy 
should build the stuff, and I'll steal it and use it later.  This is 
a list of places where one can obtain the devices that would other 
wise have to be built by hand.  But after all, a good phreak can 
take a pre-made item and adapt it to his needs.....
