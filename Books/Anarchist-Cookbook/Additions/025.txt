Anyway, for those of you who are wondering "what do the letters "LOA" under his handle stand for?" Well, LOA stands for Legion Of the Apocalypse, which is a group of elite hackers and phreakers in my area. The current members of LOA are: 
Revelation, Phreaked Out, Phreak Show, Logik Bomb, and Silicon Toad 

I started LOA when I discovered that there were many good hackers and phreakers in my area. I thought that an organized group of hackers and phreakers would accomplish much more than an individual could by himself. Thus the Legion Of the Apocalypse was formed and has been around for a while since. Our main goal is to show the public what hacking and phreaking is all about and to reveal confidential information to the hacking/phreaking community so that we can learn more about computers, telephones, electronics, etc. We are hoping to get our own World Wide Web page soon, so keep an eye out for it. It will contain all of the hacking, phreaking, computer, telephone, security, electronics, virus, and carding information that you could possibly want. 

Also, if some of you are wondering why I chose the word Revelation as my handle, well, Revelation means revealing or unveiling, which is exactly what I intend to do as a hacker/phreaker. I intend to reveal all the information that I can gather while hacking and phreaking. 

Anyway, I wrote this document because I have read all the files that I could get my hands on and noticed that there has never been a really good file written that guided beginning hackers and phreakers step by step. 

When I began hacking and started reading all of the beginner files, I still had many un-answered questions. My questions were eventually answered, but only through LOTS of reading and practice. In this file, I hope to give basic step by step instructions that will help beginning hackers and phreakers get started. But, DO NOT think that this will save you from having to read alot. If you want to be a hacker/phreaker, reading is the most important thing you can do. You will have to do ALOT of reading no matter what. 

This document was intended for beginners, but it can also be used as a reference tool for advanced hackers and phreakers. 

Please distribute this document freely. Give it to anyone that you know who is interested in hacking and/or phreaking. Post it on your World Wide Web page, Ftp sites, and BBS's. Do whatever you want with it as long as it stays UNCHANGED. 

As far as I know, this is the most complete and in depth beginners guide available, that is why I wrote it. Also, I plan to have new volumes come out whenever there has been a significant change in the material provided, so keep an eye out for them. LOA is planning on starting an on-line magazine, so look for that too. And we are also starting a hacking business. Owners of businesses can hire us to hack into their systems to find the security faults. The name of this company is A.S.H. (American Security Hackers), and it is run by LOA. If you have any questions about this company, or would like to hire us, or just want security advice, please E-Mail A.S.H. at: "revelationmail@usa.pipeline.com". Readers can also send comments and questions to this address.

I. HACKING 

A. What is hacking? 

Hacking is the act of penetrating computer systems to gain knowledge about the system and how it works. 

Hacking is illegal because we demand free access to ALL data, and we get it. This pisses people off and we are outcasted from society, and in order to stay out of prison, we must keep our status of being a hacker/phreaker a secret. We can't discuss our findings with anyone but other members of the hacking/phreaking community for fear of being punished. We are punished for wanting to learn. Why is the government spending huge amounts of time and money to arrest hackers when there are other much more dangerous people out there. It is the murderers, rapists, terrorists, kidnappers, and burglers who should be punished for what they have done, not hackers. We do NOT pose a threat to anyone. We are NOT out to hurt people or there computers. I admit that there are some people out there who call themselves hackers and who deliberately damage computers. But these people are criminals, NOT hackers. I don't care what the government says, we are NOT criminals. We are NOT trying to alter or damage any system. This is widely misunderstood. Maybe one day people will believe us when we say that all we want is to learn. 

There are only two ways to get rid of hackers and phreakers. One is to get rid of computers and telephones, in which case we would find other means of getting what we want.(Like that is really going to happen.) The other way is to give us what we want, which is free access to ALL information. Until one of those two things happen, we are not going anywhere. 

B. Why hack? 

As said above, we hack to gain knowledge about systems and the way they work. We do NOT want to damage systems in any way. If you do damage a system, you WILL get caught. But, if you don't damage anything, it is very unlikely that you will be noticed, let alone be tracked down and arrested, which costs a considerable amount of time and money. 

Beginners should read all the files that they can get their hands on about anything even remotely related to hacking and phreaking, BEFORE they start hacking. I know it sounds stupid and boring but it will definetly pay off in the future. The more you read about hacking and phreaking, the more unlikely it is that you will get caught. Some of the most useless pieces of information that you read could turn out to be the most helpful. That is why you need to read everything possible. 

C. Hacking rules 

1. Never damage any system. This will only get you into trouble. 

2. Never alter any of the systems files, except for those needed to insure that you are not detected, and those to insure that you have access into that computer in the future. 

3. Do not share any information about your hacking projects with anyone but those you'd trust with your life. 

4. When posting on BBS's (Bulletin Board Systems) be as vague as possible when describing your current hacking projects. BBS's CAN be monitered by law enforcement. 

5. Never use anyone's real name or real phone number when posting on a BBS. 

6. Never leave your handle on any systems that you hack in to. 

7. DO NOT hack government computers. 

8. Never speak about hacking projects over your home telephone line. 

9. Be paranoid. Keep all of your hacking materials in a safe place. 

10. To become a real hacker, you have to hack. You can't just sit around reading text files and hanging out on BBS's. This is not what hacking is all about. 

D. Getting started 

The very first thing you need to do is get a copy of PKZIP or some other file unzipping utility. Nearly everything that you download from the Internet or from a BBS will be zipped. A zipped file is a file that has been compressed. Zipped files end with the extension ".zip". 

Then you need to get yourself a good prefix scanner.(also known as a War Dialer) This is a program that automatically dials phone numbers beginning with the three numbers (prefix) that you specify. It checks to see if the number dialed has a carrier.(series of beeps that tells you that you have dialed a computer) Try and find a large business area prefix to scan. It is these businesses that have interesting computers. There are many good scanners out there, but I would recommend Autoscan or A-Dial. These are very easy to use and get the job done quickly and efficiently. 

E. Where and how to start hacking 

After you get yourself a good scanner, scan some prefixes and find some cool dialups, then do the following: From your terminal, dial the number you found. Then you should hear a series of beeps (carrier) which tells you that you are connecting to a remote computer. It should then say something like "CONNECT 9600" and then identify the system that you are on. If nothing happens after it says "CONNECT 9600" try hitting enter a few times. If you get a bunch of garbage adjust your parity, data bits, stop bits, baud rate, etc., until it becomes clear. 

That is one way of connecting to a remote computer. Another way is through Telenet or some other large network. 

Telenet is a very large network that has many other networks and remote computers connected to it. 

Ok, here is how you would connect to a remote computer through Telenet: 

First, you get your local dialup(phone number) from the list that I have provided in Section G. Then you dial the number from your terminal and connect.(If you get a bunch of garbage try changing your parity to odd and your data bits to 7, this should clear it up.) If it just sits there hit enter and wait a few seconds, then hit enter again. Then it will say "TERMINAL=" and you type in your terminal emulation. If you don't know what it is just hit enter. Then it will give you a prompt that looks like "@". From there you type "c" and then the NUA (Network User Address) that you want to connect to. After you connect to the NUA, the first thing you need to do is find out what type of system you are on.(i.e. UNIX, VAX/VMS, PRIME, etc.) 

There are other things that you can do on Telenet besides connecting to an NUA. Some of these commands and functions are listed in the next section. 

You can only connect to computers which accept reverse charging. The only way you can connect to computers that don't accept reverse charging is if you have a Telenet account. You can try hacking these. To do this, at the "@" prompt type "access". It will then ask you for your Telenet ID and password. 

Telenet is probably the safest place to start hacking because of the large numbers of calls that they get. Make sure you call during business hours (late morning or early afternoon) so there are many other people on-line. 

F. Telenet commands 

Here is a list of some Telenet commands and their functions. This is only a partial list. Beginners probably won't use these commands, but I put them here for reference anyway. 

COMMAND                                 FUNCTION

c                                       Connect to a host
stat                                    Shows network port

I. Telenet NUA's 
Here is a list of a few Telenet NUA's and what type of system they are. But first, this is how an NUA is put together: 

                    031106170023700
                    \   /\ /  \ /
                      |   |    |
                   DNIC Area  NUA
                        Code
The DNIC says which network connected to Telenet you are using. The area code is the area code for the area that the NUA is in. And the NUA is the address of the computer on Telenet. Please note that an NUA does NOT have to be in your area code for you to connect to it. 
There are two ways of finding useful NUA's. The first way is to get or write an NUA scanning program. The second way is to get a copy of the Legion Of Doom's Telenet Directory.( Volume 4 of the LOD Technical Journals) 

Now, here is the list. Remember that these are only a few NUA's. These are NOT all of the Telenet NUA's. All of these NUA's DO accept reverse charging. Also, please note that all of these may not be working by the time you read this and that network congestion frequently makes an NUA inaccessible for a short period of time.

J. Basic UNIX hacking 
UNIX is probably the most commonly used operating system on Telenet, and is the easiest to hack since it doesn't record bad login attempts. You know you've found a UNIX system when it gives you a "Login" prompt, and then a "Password" prompt. To get in you should first try the default logins.(Listed below.) If these don't work try some of the passwords listed in Section M. If these don't work try to find backdoors. These are passwords that may have been put in to allow the programmer (or someone else who could be in a position to make a backdoor) to get access into the system. These are usually not known about by anyone but the individual who made it. Try doing some research on the programmer and other people who helped to make the system. And, if these don't work, just try guessing them. The Login (usually the account holders name) has 1-8 characters and the Password is 6-8 characters. Both can be either letters or numbers, or a combination of the two. 

Once you get in, you should get a "$" prompt, or some other special character like it. You should only use lower case letters when hacking UNIX, this seems to be standard format. If you type "man [command]" at the prompt, it should list all of the commands for that system. Anyway, here are the default Logins and Passwords: 

Login:                          Password:

root                            root

admin                           adm

sysman                          sys

uuhost                          uuhost
guest                           guest
host                            host
nuucp                           nuucp
rje                             rje
games                           games
games                           player
sysop                           sysop
root                            sysop
demo                            demo
Once you are in, the first thing that you need to do is save the password file to your hard drive or to a disk. The password file contains the Logins and Passwords. The passwords are encoded. To get the UNIX password file, depending on what type of UNIX you are in, you can type one of the following things: 
/etc/passwd 
or 
cat /etc/passwd 

The first one is the standard command, but there are other commands as well, like the second one. Once you get the password file, it should look like this: 

john:234abc56:9999:13:John Johnson:/home/dir/john:/bin/john 

Broken down, this is what the above password file states: 

Username: john 
Encrypted Password: 234abc56 
User Number: 9999 
Group Number: 13 
Other Information: John Johnson 
Home Directory: /home/dir/john 
Shell: /bin/john 

If the password file does not show up under one of the above two commands, then it is probably shadowed. 

The following definition of password shadowing was taken from the alt.2600 hack faq: 

"Password shadowing is a security system where the encrypted password field is replaced with a special token and the encrypted password is stored in a seperate file which is not readable by normal system users." 

If the password file is shadowed, you can find it in one of the following places, depending on the type of UNIX you are using: 

UNIX System Type:               Path:                                           Token:

Some passwords can only be used for a certain amount of time without having to be changed, this is called password aging. In the password file example below, the "C.a4" is the password aging data: 
bob:123456,C.a4:6348:45:Bob Wilson:/home/dir/bob:/bin/bob 

The characters in the password aging data stand for the following: 

1. Maximum number of weeks a password can be used without changing. 
2. Minimum number of weeks a password must be used before being changed. 
3&4. Last time password was changed, in number of weeks since 1970. 

The password aging data can be decoded using the chart below:

K. Basic VAX/VMS hacking 

The VAX system runs the VMS (Virtual Memory System) operating system. You know that you have a VAX system when you get a "username" prompt. Type in capital letters, this seems to be standard on VAX's. Type "HELP" and it gives you all of the help that you could possibly want. Here are the default usernames and passwords for VAX's: 

Username:                       Password:

SYSTEM                          OPERATOR
SYSTEM                          MANAGER
SYSTEM                          SYSTEM
SYSTEM                          SYSLIB
OPERATOR                        OPERATOR
SYSTEST                         UETP
SYSTEST                         SYSTEST
SYSTEST                         TEST
SYSMAINT                        SYSMAINT
SYSMAINT                        SERVICE
SYSMAINT                        DIGITAL
FIELD                           FIELD
FIELD                           SERVICE
GUEST                           GUEST
GUEST                           unpassworded
DEMO                            DEMO
DEMO                            unpassworded
TEST                            TEST
DECNET                          DECNET
Here are some of the VAX/VMS commands: 
Command:                        Function:

HELP (H)                        Gives help and list of commands.
TYPE (T)                        View contents of a file.
RENAME (REN)                    Change name of a file.
PURGE (PU)                      Deletes old versions of a file.
PRINT (PR)                      Prints a file.
DIRECTORY (DIR)                 Shows list of files.
DIFFERENCES     (DIF)           Shows differences between files.
CREATE (CR)                     Creates a file.
DELETE (DEL)                    Deletes a file.
COPY (COP)                      Copy a file to another.
CONTINUE (C)                    Continues session.
The password file on VAX's are available when you type in the command: 
SYS$SYSTEM:SYSUAF.DAT 

The password file on most VAX's are usually not available to normal system users, but try it anyway. If the default logins don't work, use the same means of finding one as stated in Section J. 

Be VERY careful when hacking VAX's becuase they record every bad login attempt. They are sometimes considered one of the most secure systems. Because of this, I advise not to try hacking these until you are more advanced. 

But, when you are an advanced hacker, or if you are already an advanced hacker, I advise that you try a few passwords at a time and then wait and try a few more the next day and so on, because when the real user logs on it displays all of the bad login attempts. 

L. Basic PRIME hacking 

PRIME computer systems greet you with "Primecon 18.23.05", or something like it, when you connect. You should type in capital letters on this system, too. Once you connect, it will usually just sit there. If this happens, type "LOGIN ". It should then ask you for your username and password. The default usernames and passwords are listed below: 

Username:               Password:

PRIME                   PRIME
PRIME                   PRIMOS
PRIMOS                  PRIMOS
PRIMOS                  PRIME
PRIMOS_CS               PRIME
PRIMOS_CS               PRIMOS
PRIMENET                PRIMENET
SYSTEM                  SYSTEM
SYSTEM                  PRIME
SYSTEM                  PRIMOS
NETLINK                 NETLINK
TEST                    TEST
GUEST                   GUEST
GUEST1                  GUEST
When you are inside the system, type "NETLINK" and it ahould give you alot of help. This system uses NUA's, too. I might print these in the next volume.

N. Connecting modems to different phone lines 
Ok, if you are really paranoid (or smart) and you don't want to hack from your house for fear of getting caught, you can hook up your modem to other peoples phone lines or to payphones. 

If you want to hook your modem to a payphone, do it late at night and at a very secluded payphone. Look along either side of the phone. You should see a small metal tube (which contains the telephone wires) running along the wall. Somewhere along the tube it should widen out into a small box. Pop off the boxes lid and there is a nice little phone jack for ya'. Taking off the lid may be difficult because they are usually pretty secure, but nothing is impossible, so keep trying. Of course, you can only do this with a lap-top computer. 

Now, if you want to hook up the modem to someone's house or appartment phone line, you need to get a pair of red and green alligator clips, and an extra modem cord for your lap-top. After you get those parts, cut the plastic end off of your modem cord and you will see a red wire, a green wire, and two other wires, but you can ignore those. Attach the red alligator clip to the red wire, and attach the green alligator clip to the green wire and you're all set. Now all you need to do is go find a telephone pole or one of those small green boxes that stick out of the ground.(They should have a Bell Systems logo on them.) 

On a telephone pole open the little box that has a bunch of wires going to and from it. On the right side of the box you should see what look like two large screws.(These are called "terminals".) One should have a red wire wrapped around it and the other should have a green wire wrapped around it. Attach the red alligator clip the the red wire and the green alligator clip to the green wire, and you're all set. This should get you a dial tone. If it doesn't, make sure that the alligator clips are not touching each other, and that the alligator clips are attached to the exposed end of the wire. 

Now, on those green boxes you need to undo all of the screws and shit holding the lid on, and open it up. Then you should find basically the same setup as in the telephone pole. Attach the appropriate wires to the appropriate terminals and you are all set. 

This process can also be used to hook up a Beige Box (Lineman's Handset.) when phreaking. 

O. Viruses, Trojans, and Worms 

Just in case some of you are interested, here are the definitions for Viruses, Trojans, and Worms. These definitions were taken from the alt.2600 hack faq. 

Trojan: 

"Remember the Trojan Horse? Bad guys hid inside it until they could get into the city to do their evil deed. A Trojan computer program is similiar. It is a program which does an unauthorized function, hidden inside an authorized program. It does something other than it claims to do, usually something malicious (although not necessarily!), and it is intended by the author to do whatever it does. If it is not intentional, it is called a bug or, in some cases, a feature :) Some Virus scanning programs detect some Trojans. Some scanning programs don't detect any Trojans. No Virus scanners detect all Trojans." 

Virus: 

"A Virus is an independent program which reproduces itself. It may attach itself to other programs, it may create copies of itself (as in companion Viruses). It may damage or corrupt data, change data, or degrade the performance of your system by utilizing resources such as memory or disk space. Some Viruse scanners detect some Viruses. No Virus scanners detect all Viruses. No Virus scanner can protect against any and all Viruses, known and unknown, now and forevermore." 

Worm: 

"Made famous by Robert Morris, Jr., Worms are programs which reproduce by copying themselves over and over, system to system, using up resources and sometimes slowing down the system. They are self contained and use the networks to spread, in much the same way that Viruses use files to spread. Some people say the solution to Viruses and worms is to just not have any files or networks. They are probably correct. We could include computers." 

II. PHREAKING 

A. What is phreaking 

Phreaking is basically hacking with a telephone. Using different "boxes" and "tricks" to manipulate the phone companies and their phones, you gain many things, two of which are: knowledge about telephones and how they work, and free local and long distance phone calls. In the following sections, you will learn some about boxes, what they are, and how they work. You will also learn about the other forms of phreaking. 

B. Why phreak? 

Phreaking, like hacking, is used to gather information about telephones, telephone companies, and how they work. There are other benefits as well. As stated above, you also get free phone calls. But, these are used mainly to gather more information about the phones, and to allow us free access to all information. 

C. Phreaking rules 

Most of the same rules apply for hacking and phreaking, so I will only list a few here. 

1. Never box over your home phone line. 
2. You should never talk about phreaking projects over your home phone line. 
3. Never use your real name when phreaking. 
4. Be careful who you tell about your phreaking projects. 
5. Never leave phreaking materials out in the open. Keep them in a safe place. 
6. Don't get caught. 

D. Where and how to start phreaking 

Well, you can phreak on any telephone, but as stated above, it is very stupid to do so on your home phone line. First you need you need to construct the boxes needed for what you want to do. All of the boxes and their descriptions are listed in the next section. Most of the boxes are very easy to make, but if your not into making shit, there are usually alternative ways of making them. 

E. Boxes and what they do

F. Box Plans 
The Red Box is the main tool that you will use so I have included the Red Box plans. The other box plans can be downloaded from the Internet. 

Red Box: 

There are two ways that you can make a Red Box: 

One is to go to Radio Shack and buy a tone dialer and a 6.5536Mhz crystal. (If Radio Shack doesn't have the crystal, you can order them from the electronics companies that I have listed at the end of this section.) Open up the tone dialer and replace the existing crystal (big, shiny, metal thing labeled "3.579545Mhz") with the 6.5536Mhz crystal. Now, close it up. You have a red box. To use it for long distance calls play the tones that add up to the amount of money that the operator requests. For a 25 cents tone press 5 *'s. For a 10 cents tone press 3 *'s. For a 5 cents tone press 1 *. And, the second way, which is a much easier method, is to get the Red Box tones from a phreaking program, such as: Omnibox, or Fear's Phreaker Tools. Play the tones as you hold a microcassette recorder about 1-inch away from your computer speakers, and record the tones. The Red Box only works on public telephones, it does not work on COCOT's. (Defined in next section.) It makes the telephone think that you have put money in. Red Boxes do not work on local calls because the phone is not using ACTS (Automated Coin Toll System), unless you call the operator and have her place the call for you. You tell her the number that you want to dial and then when she asks you to put in your money, play the tones. If she asks you why you need her to place the call tell her that one of the buttons is smashed in or something like that. You now have and know how to use a Red Box!

G. Free calling from COCOT's 

First of all, COCOT stands for "Customer Owned Customer Operated Telephone". These are most likely to be found at resteraunts, amusement parks, etc. All you have to do to make a free call from a COCOT is dial a 1-800 number (they let you do this for free), say some bullshit and get them to hang up on you. Stay on the line after they hang up, then dial the number that you want to call. This may not work by the time you read this because COCOT owners are becoming more aware of us every day. 

H. ANAC numbers 

ANAC stands for "Automated Number Announcment Circuit". In other words, you call the ANAC number in your area and it tells you the number that you are calling from. This is useful when Beige Boxing, or hooking your modem up to other phone lines, to find out what number you are using. The "?" are substituted for unknown numbers. Do some scanning to find them out. Here are the ANAC numbers for the U.S.A. with their area code, and the only one I knew of in the U.K.: 

U.S.A.:

Area Code:                              ANAC Number:

Handle:

Thanks for your help guys. 

K. Hacker's Manifesto 

"This is our world now...the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt cheep if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore...and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias...and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, wage wars, murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it is for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual, but you can't stop us all...after all, we're all alike." 

+++The Mentor+++ 

L. Happy hacking! 

Be careful and have fun. Remember to keep your eye out for the next volume of The Ultimate Beginner's Guide To Hacking And Phreaking and the Legion Of the Apocalypse W.W.W. page. Oh, and keep looking for our on-line magazine, too, it should be coming out soon. Well, I hope you enjoyed the file and found it informative. I also hope that I helped get you started in hacking and phreaking.
