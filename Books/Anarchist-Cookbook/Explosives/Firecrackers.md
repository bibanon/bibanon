     Most, if not all, of the information in this publication can be obtained
through a public or university library.  There are also many publications that
are put out by people who want to make money by telling other people how to
make explosives at home.  Adds for such appear frequently in paramilitary
magazines and newspapers.  This list is presented to show the large number of
places that information and materials can be purchased from.   It also
includes fireworks companies and the like.

BOOKS
컴컴
THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK II-IV          (highly circulated)

THE IMPROVISED MUNITIONS MANUAL    (formulas work, but put maker at risk)

MILITARY EXPLOSIVES


   Two manuals of interest:  Duponts "Blaster's Handbook", a $20 manual mainly
useful for rock and seismographic operations.  Atlas's "Powder Manual" or
"Manual of Rock Blasting" (I forget the title, it's in the office).  This is a
$60 book, well worth the cash, dealing with the above two topics, plus
demolitions, and non-quarry blasting.
