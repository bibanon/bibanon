                   Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the first issue of 'The Remote Informer'!  This newsletter
is reader supported.  If the readers of this newsletter do not help
support it, then it will end.  We are putting this out to help out the
ones that would like to read it.  If you are one of those who thinks they
know everything, then don't bother reading it.  This newsletter is not
anything like the future issues.  The future issues will contain several
sections, as long as reader input is obtained.  Below is an outline
overview of the sections in the future issues.

I/O Board (Input/Output Board)

The I/O Board is for questions you have, that we might be able to
answer or atleast refer you to someone or something.  We will be honest if
we cannot help you.  We will not make up something, or to the effect, just
to make it look like we answered you.  There will be a section in the I/O
Board for questions we cannot answer, and then the readers will have the
opportunity to answer it.  We will print anything that is reasonable in
the newsletter, even complaints if you feel like you are better than
everyone.

NewsCenter

This section will be for news around the underworld.  It will talk of
busts of people in the underworld and anything else that would be
considered news.  If you find articles in the paper, or something happens
in your local area, type it up, and upload it to one of the boards listed
at the end of the newsletter.  Your handle will be placed in the article.
If you do enter a news article, please state the date and from where you
got it.

Feature Section

The Feature Section will be the largest of the sections as it will be
on the topic that is featured in that issue.  This will be largely reader
input which will be sent in between issues.  At the end of the issue at
hand, it will tell the topic of the next issue, therefore, if you have
something to contribute, then you will have ample time to prepare your
article.

Hardware/Software Review
In this section, we will review the good and bad points of hardware
and software related to the underworld.  It will be an extensive review,
rather than just a small paragraph.

The Tops

This section will be the area where the top underworld BBS's, hacking
programs, modem scanners, etc. will be shown.  This will be reader
selected and will not be altered in anyway.  The topics are listed below.
Underworld BBS's (Hack, Phreak, Card, Anarchy, etc.)
Hacking programs for Hayes compatables
Hacking programs for 1030/Xm301 modems
Modem scanners for Hayes compatables
Modem scanners for 1030/Xm301 modems
Other type illegal programs
You may add topics to the list if enough will support it.

Tid Bits

This will contain tips and helpful information sent in by the users.
If you have any information you wish to contribute, then put it in a text
file and upload it to one of the BBS's listed at the end of the
newsletter.
Please, no long distance codes, mainframe passwords, etc.
We may add other sections as time goes by.  This newsletter will not
be put out on a regular basis.  It will be put out when we have enough
articles and information to put in it.  There may be up to 5 a month, but
there will always be at least one a month.  We would like you, the readers,
to send us anything you feel would be of interest to others, like hacking
hints, methods of hacking long distance companies, companies to card from,
etc.  We will maintain the newsletter as long as the readers support it.
That is the end of the introduction, but take a look at this newsletter,
as it does contain information that may be of value to you.

                      Hacking Sprint: The Easy Way
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             By: Tracker

If you hack US Sprint, 950-0777 (by the way it is no longer GTE
Sprint), and you are fustrated at hacking several hours only to find one
or two codes, then follow these tips, and it will increase your results
tremendously.  First, one thing that Mr. Mojo proved is that Sprint will
not store more than one code in every hundred numbers.  (ex: 98765400 to
98765499 may contain only one code).   There may NOT be a code in that
hundred, but there will never be more than one.
Sprint's 9 digit codes are stored from 500000000 through 999999999.
In the beginning of Sprint's 950 port, they only had 8 digit codes.  Then
they started converting to 9 digit codes, storing all 8 digit codes
between 10000000 and 49999999 and all 9 digit codes between 500000000 and
999999999.  Sprint has since cancelled most 8 digit codes, although there
are a few left that have been denoted as test codes.  Occaisionally, I
hear of phreaks saying they have 8 digit codes, but when verifying them,
the codes were invalid.
Now, where do you start?  You have already narrowed the low and high
numbers in half, therefore already increasing your chances of good results
by 50 percent.  The next step is to find a good prefix to hack.  By the
way, a prefix, in hacking terms, is the first digits in a code that can be
any length except the same number of digits the code is.  (ex: 123456789
is a code.  That means 1, 12, 123, 1234, 12345, 123456, 1234567, and
12345678 are prefixes)  The way you find a good prefix to hack is to
manually enter a code prefix.  If when you enter the code prefix and a
valid destination number and you do not hear the ringing of the recording
telling you that the code is invalid until near the end of the number,
then you know the prefix is valid.  Here is a chart to follow when doing
this:
Code      - Destination    Range good codes exist
-------------------------------------------------
123456789 - 6192R           123400000 - 123499999
123456789 - 619267R         123450000 - 123459999
123456789 - 61926702R       123456000 - 123456999
123456789 - 6192670293R     123456700 - 123456799
-------------------------------------------------
( R - Denotes when ring for recording starts)
To prove 
this true, I ran a test using OmniHack 1.3p, written by
Jolly Joe.  In this test I found a prefix where the last 3 digits were all
I had to hack.  I tested each hundred of the 6 digit prefix finding that
all but 4 had the ring start after the fourth digit was dialed in the
destination number.  The other four did not ring until I had finished the
entire code.  I set OmniHack to hack the prefix + 00 until prefix + 99.
(ex: xxxxxxy00 to xxxxxxy99: where y is one of the four numbers that the
ring did not start until the dialing was completed.)  Using this method, I
found four codes in a total of 241 attempts using ascending hacking (AKA:
Sequential).  Below you will see a record of my hack:
Range of hack            Codes found     Tries
----------------------------------------------
xxxxxx300 - xxxxxx399     xxxxxx350        50
xxxxxx500 - xxxxxx599     xxxxxx568        68
xxxxxx600 - xxxxxx699     xxxxxx646        46
xxxxxx800 - xxxxxx899     xxxxxx877        77
----------------------------------------------
Totals                     4 codes        241
As you see, these methods work.  Follow these guidlines and tips and
you should have an increase in production of codes in the future hacking
Sprint.  Also, if you have any hints/tips you think others could benefit
from, then type them up and upload them to one of the boards at the end of
the newsletter.

                         Rumors: Why Spread Them?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              By: Tracker
Do you ever get tired of hearing rumors?  You know, someone gets an
urge to impress others, so they create a rumor that some long distance
company is now using tracing equipment.  Why start rumors?  It only scares
others out of phreaking, and then makes you, the person who started the
rumor, look like Mr. Big.  This article is short, but it should make you
aware of the rumors that people spread for personal gain.  The best thing
to do is to denote them as a rumor starter and then leave it at that.  You
should not rag on them constantly, since if the other users cannot
determine if it is fact or rumor, then they should suffer the
consequences.
==========================================================================
                     The New Sprint FON Calling Cards
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               By: Tracker
US Sprint has opened up a new long distance network called the Fiber
Optic Network (FON), in which subscribers are given calling cards.  These
calling cards are 14 digits, and though, seem randomly generated, they are
actually encrypted.  The rumors floating around about people getting
caught using the Sprint FON calling cards are fact, not rumors.  The
reason people are getting caught is that they confuse the FON calling
cards with the local 950 port authorization codes.  If you will remember,
you never use AT&T calling cards from you home phone.  It has ANI
capability, which is not tracing, but rather the originating phone number
is placed on the bill as soon as the call is completed.  They know your
phone number when you call the 800 access port, but they do not record it
until your call is completed.  Also, through several of my hacks, I came
up with some interesting information surrounding the new Sprint network.
They are listed below.
800-877-0000
This number is for information on US Sprint's 800 calling card
service.  I have not played around with it, but I believe it is for
trouble or help with the FON calling cards.  I am not sure if it is for
subscribing to the FON network.
800-877-0002 - You hear a short tone, then nothing.
800-877-0003 - US Sprint Alpha Test Channel #1
800-877-(0004-0999)
When you call these numbers, you get a recording saying: "Welcome to
US Sprint's 1 plus service."  When the recording stops, if you hit the
pound key (#) you will get the calling card dial tone.
Other related Sprint numbers
800-521-4949   This is the number that you subscribe to US Sprint with.
You may also subscribe to the FON network on this number.  It will take 4
to 5 weeks for your calling card to arrive.
10777
This is US Sprint's equal access number.  When you dial this number,
you then dial the number you are calling, and it will be billed through US
Sprint, and you will receive their long distance line for that call.  Note
that you will be billed for calls made through equal access.  Do not
mistake it to be a method of phreaking, unless used from a remote
location.
If you are in US Sprint's 1+ service then call 1+700-555-1414, which
will tell you which long distance company you are using.  When you hear:
"Thank you for choosing US Sprint's 1 plus service," hit the pound key
(#), and then you will get the US Sprint dial tone.  This however is just
the same as if you are calling from your home phone if you dial direct, so
you would be billed for calls made through that, but there are ways to use
this to your advantage as in using equal access through a PBX.
==========================================================================
                   Automatic Number Identification (ANI)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             By: Tracker

The true definition for Automatic Number Identification has not been
widely known to many.  Automatic Number Identification, (AKA: ANI), is the
process of the destination number knowing the originating number, which is
where you are calling from.  The method of achieving this is to send the
phone number that you are calling from in coded form ahead of the
destination number. Below is an example of this.
ANI Method
Dial: 267-0293
Sent: ********2670293
* - Denotes the originating number which is coded and sent before the
    number
As you noticed there are 8 digits in the coded number.  This is
because, at least I believe, it is stored in a binary-like form. 
Automatic Number Identification means a limited future in phreaking. ANI
does not threaten phreaking very much yet, but it will in the near future.
A new switching system will soon be installed in most cities that are
covered by ESS, Electronic Switching System, now. 
The system will have ANI capabilities which will be supplied to the
owners of phone lines as an›added extra.  The owner's phone will have
an LED read-out that will show the phone number of the people that
call you.  You will be able to block some numbers, so that people
cannot call you.  This system is in the testing stages currently, but will
soon be installed across most of the country.  As you see, this will
end a large part of phreaking, until we, the phreakers, can come up with
an alternative.  As I have been told by several, usually reliable,
people, this system is called ISS, which I am not sure of the meaning of
this, and is being tested currently in Rhode Island.
800 in-watts lines set up by AT&T support ANI.  The equipment to
decode an ANI coded origination number does not costs as much as you would
expect.  950 ports do not offer ANI capability, no matter what you have
been told.  The 950 ports will only give the city in which they are based,
this usually being the largest in the state, sometimes the capitol.
One last thing that I should tell you is that ANI is not related to
tracing.  Tracing can be done on any number whether local, 950, etc.  One
way around this, especially when dialing Alliance TeleConferencing, is to
dial through several extenders or ports.  ANI will only cover the number
that is calling it, and if you call through a number that does not support
ANI, then your number will never be known.
