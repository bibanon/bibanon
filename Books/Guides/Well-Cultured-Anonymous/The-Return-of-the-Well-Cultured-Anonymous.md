**The Return of the Well Cultured Anonymous** is an updated book, based on the original **Well Cultured Anonymous**, which was painstakingly built by fellow [[Anonymous]] on [[Wikichan]]. It attempts to show others (primarily other Anonymous) how to be sophisticated, talented, and polite in today's modern world.

Some parts need to be updated, important topics need to be added, and a few pages need to be customized for a girl's point of view. If you can help with this, just go ahead when you feel like it.

We added "The Return" to this book's title, since it was entirely lost in it's original form after Wikichan fell apart. Some parts still live on in [Well-Cultured](http://www.wellcultured.com), a spammy website made by the last Wikichan admin in a failed attempt to make a shitty men's magazine. Because of the unfortunate fate of such an informative guide, we have restored the original and reopened it to editing.

## Intro

You have seen them everywhere – self help topics of Anonymous begging for help with his life. Some people have no idea how they should dress other than wearing a Pantera t-shirt with jeans that their mother bought for them five years ago. Some have no idea how to approach women and spend their time [[masturbating|Masturbation]] to [[Loli]]. And some just want to know if they should shave their [[pubes|Grooming]].

Here, my friends, is your answer. Written by anon, edited by anon, and perfected by anon. Every single tip, trick, and [[Barrel Roll]] you will ever need to know without having to ask for help. The first chapters of this Wikibook will intend to enlighten and refresh your memory on the basics- how to look decent, how to keep in shape, and that kind of thing. Then, it will segue into other people- how to pick up women, how to handle other people, and how to have a dinner party where you don't throw food. Then, the miscellaneous things- [[College]], protips and tricks, and basically anything else you could ever want to know.

Read away. Edit away. Learn, Anonymous.
