I found this on [a tumblr](http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/21533650696/help-the-girl-i-like-wont-respond-to-my-emails). I'll format it better later.

Also I just noticed the titles were different for each thread, so I'll fix that later too.

#First thread
A tale from 2ch of girls, emails, and hamsters. (Posts from the thread-starter are labeled #OP, the people replying to him are labeled #2ch.)

##OP
There’s this girl I’ve had feelings for since high school, and now we’re in college together. We’ll call her Denko.
Once we hit second year, we went out drinking, and I worked up the courage to exchange numbers.
We started out talking often, but she hasn’t answered me in three days now.
I’m getting depressed just thinking that Denko might be sick, or that something happened to her… (´･ω･`)
Please, somebody give me some advice.

###2ch
SHE DOESN’T LIKE YOU.
GIVE IT UP.

###2ch
Maybe it’s ‘cause email’s a pain in the butt.

##OP
Well, I called her too in case she was sick or something happened… (´･ω･`)

Maybe this last email I sent did something to hurt Denko’s feelings? Give me your opinion here…
"Yahoo! Good weather today. You haven’t emailed me or called me, so I’m just sending this since I’m worried.
Did I do something bad? PS. The stars were pretty last night.”

###2ch
[RAMEN POSTS]

##OP
Wh… This isn’t a thread about ramen, okay?!
I’m begging you, I need advice!
I haven’t slept for an entire day…

###2ch
Just hypothetically, what would you think if you got an email like that from an ugly girl you don’t have any interest in?

##OP
Umm… Well, I wouldn’t like it.
But I’ve had my eye on Denko since high school, and…
I don’t know how to say it, but I think it might be mutual… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
Pretty sure she hates you and is too shy to say it… ///

###2ch
I’ll divine OP and his girl’s love from her birthday.
Post OP’s birthday too, if possible.

##OP
My birthday’s March 10th, Denko’s is September 7th…

#2ch
To be perfectly honest, your emails sound incredibly shifty.
That’s why everyone is talking about ramen instead…

#OP
Sorry, I haven’t had much experience talking to girls… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
So you got responses before?
What kind of emails are you sending?
It could be, you know, interesting…

#OP
At first, we just talked about how strange it was we only started emailing in college despite being in the same year of high school.
What I’m sending… well, I’m worried about her lack of reply, so I’ve sent her around 600 emails.
They’re mostly reports on my current mental state, I guess…? (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Sending 600 emails out of worry from the lack of response… How spammy can you get…

#OP
Don’t make fun of me, okay!
I don’t have any friends, so you’re the only people I can ask about this!

#2ch
…(゜д゜)

#OP
600 emails and still no reply, so I’m really thinking something might have happened… (´･ω･`)
And I really don’t think they’re anything that would displease her. They’re like this:
"I’m drinking jasmine tea right now, thinking about what to have for dinner."
Maybe they’re a bit too incidental?

#2ch
Troll sighted.
And if you’re not? Give it up.

#2ch
Knows he doesn’t have any friends.
Oozes human filth right down to his emoticons.
And sending 600 emails in three days is stalker-level creepy…

#OP
Alright, alright, maybe people think I’m creepy!
But even so, I’m really, honestly in love with this girl!
You understand, right? I’ll try not to be as creepy about it from now on!
So please, give me advice on how to get Denko to respond!

#2ch
You seriously sent 600 emails in three days? lol

#OP
Well, I think it was only around 50 the first two days… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Why wouldn’t she respond if she wasn’t dumping you?
If something happened, maybe her power went out!
Try calling her up, it should at least get her attention.

#OP
All right, I’ll try calling her. But I’m awful at talking, so give me something to talk about.

#2ch
I want to see what your conversations were like when you got replies.

#OP
Me: “What do you do for fun? What do you listen to? I like watching lots of movies and reading lots of books, I guess… (´･ω･`)”
Denko: “Umm, I dunno. You sure use a lot of emoticons, huh?”
That sort of thing.

#2ch
LOL, wow did she cut things short…
Did it ever go on any longer than that?

#OP
Me: “Do girls do the thing where you turn socks inside-out to use them for a week?”
Denko: “No, that’s too dirty. I usually wash them after a day.”
Me: “Well, Denko’s socks can’t possibly be dirty! Unlike mine… (´･ω･`)”
Denko: “Do you really wear the same socks for a week?”
Me: “No, uh, I heard about it from a friend.”

Like that.

#OP
I’M CALLING HER NOW

#OP
SHE’S ON

#2ch
RUN FOR YOUR LIFE, DENKO!!

#OP
OH GOD I WAS SO NERVOUS I PANICKED AND HUNG UP ON HER (´；ω；`)

#2ch
The cherry blossoms! Invite her to go see the cherry blossoms, OP!!!

#OP
Okay, I’ll do that! I’m too tense to use the phone right now, so I’ll send her an email.

I’ve never been so nervous about talking to somebody aaaaaUUUUUGH (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Oh for the love of… apologize for hanging up.
This’ll be your last chance.

#OP
Ohh… do you really want me to call her again?
I sent her an email saying I knew I shouldn’t have hung up, and my heart just wasn’t ready…

#2ch
God damn, I’ve never seen such a revolting sack of crap.
I’ve got a good idea of why you can’t get Denko, or any friends period.

I’m guessing you’ve been bullied all your life?

#OP
I was bullied in grade school, but I’ve been fine since college.

#2ch
(´･ω･`) ← This is starting to piss me off.

#2ch
This should go down as one of the most terrifying incidents to occur on 2chan.

#2ch
Here you go, OP.
1. What classes are you taking?
2. I’m bored -> Can we go see the cherry blossoms at night?

#OP
Oh! You must be popular, huh? (´･ω･`)
Okay, I’m going to try calling again with that.

My armpits are sweating real bad, though…

#OP
YSEYESYES

#2ch
What is this, a romance board?

#2ch
Are you willing to call this romance? lol

#2ch
I had a stalker once too, but it’s even scarier to think he had the same thought processes as this guy.
600 emails? You gotta be trolling. Please tell me that’s a troll.

#OP
I TALKED WITH DENKO! And I invited her to see the cherry blossoms!
Apparently her schedule was packed at work, so she said some other time! Oh well, still good news!
Gotta buy some clothes now… (´･ω･`) Hurry hurry…

I accidentally told her about how I was sweating really bad, haha…
And she said she was sorry she was too busy to reply to my emails. (´･ω･`)
For now, I’m glad Denko is safe. I was worried what might happen since I’m so bad at talking to girls, but I guess I managed…

#2ch
You’re serious.

#2ch
>She said some other time!
>She said some other time!
>She said some other time!

#2ch
WHY ARE YOU GOING CLOTHES SHOPPING IF YOU GOT REJECTED

there is sUCH A THING AS BEING TOO OPTIMISTIC??

#2ch
"Some other time" = "never talk to me again you creep"

#2ch
Okay, she hates you, no doubt.

#2ch
Oh, OP…
If this isn’t a troll, please, give this up now.

#OP
Are you guys trying to trick me since I don’t have much experience with girls?
I’m wondering when I should send another email… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
What were your meetings with Denko like?
What made you fall for her?

#OP
Denko helped me out when I was being badly bullied in high school.
Denko’s smart and kind, so she was like everyone’s role model.
When I sat next to her in class, I often borrowed her notebooks and erasers and we became friends.
We made eye contact a lot in class, too… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
That’s probably because you were the one looking, creep.

Absolutely despicable. After 600 emails, even if she DID like you before, you’ve ruined it.

#OP
I SENT 600 EMAILS BECAUSE THERE WAS A CHANCE SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I WAS WORRIED.
I’m telling the truth here, okay?
Anyway, a reply!! I’m kind of scared to read it, haha…

#2ch
You’re hopeless. Find out her house and her workplace.
Girls love overbearing go-getter guys.
OP, do this if you can: Follow her to her work, her house, and her classes every day.

#OP
THAT’S JUST BEING A STALKER (´･ω･`)
I don’t want Denko to hate me… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
>I don’t want Denko to hate me
>I don’t want Denko to hate me
>I don’t want Denko to hate me

#2ch
I know I’D hate you.

#2ch
Serious post here.
If you don’t get a reply after three times, stop.
If she’s making excuses about work and busyness, she really doesn’t like you.

She’s only not saying it because she thinks it would hurt you.
Denko getting 600 emails from a guy who isn’t even her boyfriend is no doubt going to scare her.
But she’s probably a nice girl if she isn’t admitting it.

There are people out there who just can’t be blunt.
So stop it, please.

#2ch
Even from a boyfriend, 600 emails in three days is scary.

#2ch
Giving girls small animals as presents makes them most happy. ^^
Stuff thirty hamsters in a box and send them to her house, and she’ll be so surprised she’ll fall for OP in a flash!
So yeah, I think a thirty-hamster present would be good. ^^

#2ch
Girls love to get clothes. The price of the clothes and their attraction to you are directly proportional.

#OP
Oh geez, I don’t think I could afford that…
Anyway, we’re making plans for four of us to get together!
I’m so grateful! And so tense! Oh my god…

#2ch
What clothes do you own?

#OP
Plain shirts I wore in high school, and some denim shorts my mom got at Yokado.
Also, I guess I wear sweatjackets a lot.
I wonder if I can get clothes in Harajuku? (´･ω･`)

#2ch
OP’s a super cool guy.
His girl’s just shy.
It’s true love, man.

#OP
The contents of her reply:
I’m not really sure what to say, but sorry I was too busy to reply to your emails.
My schedule is probably too packed to see the cherry blossoms this year. *crying emoticon*
Oh, also, I saw your brother on TV again! [He’s a former actor]
My friend says she wants to go drinking with your brother, me, and you. What do you think?

#2ch
I was wondering this whole time why Denko didn’t reject the OP, but now I think I know.

#OP
Looks like we’re going drinking tomorrow!
Gotta buy clothes now… (´･ω･`)
Would a suit and a necktie be safe?

#2ch
Didn’t she say she was busy?

Don’t you find that weird that she’s suddenly good for tomorrow?

#OP
Well, she’s free in the evening, and cherry blossoms would be in the day, so it’s possible?

#OP
Do you think I should bring a present?
Tell me what would make girls happy… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
No, no presents.
If you bring a present every time, Denko’ll just think OP’s her personal ATM.
Don’t do it, for the future of OP and Denko both.

#OP
I see… So not even a picture of a small animal? (´･ω･`)

Konaka’s open, so I’m gonna go buy a striped suit.

#2ch
A picture? Don’t be silly…
Feeling the warmth of a little creature makes a woman’s heart tremble. Buy hamsters. Nothing but hamsters.
Then stuff them in a box, of course.

#OP
I went to email my brother about trying to be free tomorrow night, but he changed his address and number… (´･ω･`)
I’m asking my mom about it now.

#2ch
OP, girls love sweet things too.
So once you’ve got your hamsters packed into a box, sprinkle the hamsters with about 10 kg of sugar until they’re hidden.
1. Girl opens box and can see nothing but sugar.
2. Hamster leaps out from sugar.
3. Girl is surprised! But hamsters are cute. Heart!
4. OP is so clever. Love! Heart.

Got it? Get to it, OP!

#2ch
Reading this thread reminds me that there are people like this, and reassures me that I’m doing just fine.

#OP
Well, I emailed Denko saying I wasn’t able to get a hold of my brother.
Nothing to really report while I’m waiting for her reply… (´･ω･`)

#OP
ALSO YOU GUYS CALLING ME CREEPY AND HOPELESS ARE REALLY MAKING ME LOSE CONFIDENCE. (´･ω･`)

#2ch
>implying you had confidence before

#OP
Still no reply, so I’m going to send another one.
Post 400 decides the title.

#OP
Actually, you’ll probably say something weird, so never mind. (´･ω･`)

#2ch
You’re being a pest if you send more than three emails without a reply.
Also, you should learn how to have a proper conversation.
Stop trying to push yourself and listen to her more.

#OP
What should I ask? I’ve never talked with girls…
I don’t know what I should talk about… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
You’ve got a completely wrong idea of what “listen” means.

"Listening" is not "questioning."
What he was trying to say is that you shouldn’t talk about yourself, but listen to what she says.

Also, I said it before, but just be mature and wait if there’s no reply. Patience, man.

#OP
Well, I told Denko to email me when she has the time.
Also, I invited her to just have three of us go if my brother can’t come. (´･ω･`)

#2ch
His brother is definitely looking like the real target here…

#OP
Reading all these responses again, I realize it’s like 70% abuse and 30% ramen…
I knew I was getting teased for not having any romantic experience, but I didn’t quite realize it was that bad…
It’s a bit of a shock… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Screw you guys. OP’s persistence should be COMMENDED.

Sending massive amounts of emails out of worry!
Buying clothes to improve his appearance!

And I say try even harder!
Send 1000 emails a day!
Girls love men who worry about them!

#OP
Oh! A serious reply at last! (´･ω･`)
Yes, I’ll try my hardest! Thanks for the uplifting comments!

I just emailed Denko about what kinds of clothes she likes men to wear.
Uh oh, I wonder if she’ll figure out I like her…

#2ch
You really must be an aspie if you thought that was serious…

#OP
Oh, since you guys call me creepy and scary, I’m wondering if I should send an email asking if I’m scary… (´･ω･`)
Do people send emails like that?

#2ch
I guess, maybe…
If you don’t at least ask, you might not be able to face each other.
Give it a shot.

#OP
I sent it. Can’t wait for the reply… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Let’s think about this sensibly.

If I heard an email alert going off several hundred times a day…
Yeah, I’d call the police.

#OP
Well, I’d be happy if I got that many emails from her… (´･ω･`)

#OP
Still no reply… What do I do?
I’m getting worried… (´･ω･`)

But everyone seems to say I should let her send emails to me and just reply to those.
It’s really irritating, though. What makes girls happy?

#2ch
YOU NOT EMAILING HER WOULD BE GREAT

#OP
Hey! Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.

If you’re all so experienced with love, maybe that’s why you don’t understand how I feel…

#OP
I got an email from Denko!
"Maybe a little scary…"
Only a little is okay, right?
I want to make sure there’s no misunderstanding… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
If you want to clear up misunderstanding, send an email.
"Sorry to scare you. But don’t misunderstand. I just want to be friends, Denko."
Keep sending emails like that.

You’ve already sent over 600, so just sending one at this point would make you look insincere.
So send at least twenty.
Even that might be too few.

#OP
I don’t know about sending repeatedly, so I’ll just send this once:
"Sorry to scare you. But don’t misunderstand. I just want to be friends, Denko."
Still, thanks!

#2ch
Whoa, man, think about it the other way around.

Say you’ve gotten 600 emails from Denko.
But all of a sudden, there’s just this one.
Wouldn’t you be uneasy?

If you don’t want to upset Denko, send more!

#OP
What exactly is scaring her, though?
I’m doing the best I can, but I don’t want to be called scary, not even “maybe a little” scary…
It’s really annoying me… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Even if she doesn’t want to say it, man you’re scary.

#OP
Yikes… Am I really that bad…? (´･ω･`)
It’s not like I want to punch people or kill people out of love for Denko, right?
Please, tell me something I can say to make her happy and not leave any misunderstandings.

#2ch
How about the new teriyaki burger at McDonald’s?

#OP
Okay, thanks! I just asked “Do you know if the new teriyaki burger at McDonald’s is good?”
But if I can really clear up misunderstanding by emailing Denko stuff like that, then my mood might start to turn around…

#OP
So many people have called me scary that I feel traumatized…
But all right, I’ll be careful not to make any more aggressive emails.
Thanks for the advice!!
You guys are so experienced, haha…

#2ch
I don’t think this has anything to do with experience…
Man, poor Denko.

#2ch
Experienced or not, I can’t comprehend how you don’t get things that everyone should know.

#2ch
I know where you’re coming from, unfortunately.

I’m kind of figuring the OP has played a lot of dating sims and such.
In those games, you need to take action for your bond to go up, but…
You can’t go into real life thinking it works that way…

#OP
Yes, you hit the bullseye.
I really have no clue how to handle three-dimensional women.

It’s so easy to confess in games, but so hard in three dimensions…
Now I know that all too well… (´･ω･`)

#OP
Actually… I’m starting to feel like it might be best for me to wholeheartedly confess to Denko.

Is that just me? (´･ω･`)

#2ch
It’s best that this ends soon.
Do it and be done with it.

#2ch
Geez, we told you not to be so forward…

But, maybe you should be more thoroughly crushed…

#OP
My hands are shaking at the idea of a confession email…
This might be a tough hurdle to overcome…

#OP
I’m trying to think about what to write, but other than “I love you,” I’m drawing a blank… (´･ω･`)

#OP
Subject: To Denko

Thinking on it now, our meeting was a cherry blossom blooming in high school.
And now, it’s spring again just the same.

Before I met you, Denko, I felt like I was in a cold winter.
But in the spring, you put a bud in my heart that would bloom into a great flower.
It’s been so long since we were in high school together, but my feelings are just the same as they were that spring.

You’ve helped me when I was bullied, haven’t you, Denko?
Back then, I thought, “Why does this girl not have the wings an angel should have?”
I suppose you must have left them in your mother’s stomach…

Even when we met eyes, I didn’t have the courage.
And we could never talk to each other.
But now, I’m different!
Denko, I know you may not want to marry me yet, but please, go out with me!

Well? (´･ω･`)

#2ch
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME

#2ch
Perfection.
Nothing can be done to improve it.

#2ch
This is worse than the love letter I wrote in fifth grade.

#2ch
I don’t even…

#OP
Well, I sent it. (´･ω･`)
Normally I’m very prudent, but today, with all of your encouragement, I’ve confessed.

If Denko and I start dating, I hope we can read this thread and laugh about it together… (´･ω･`)
Also, since I wanted to increase my chances, I added that no matter what happens, I won’t give up on her.

#2ch
oh god holy geez what in the

#2ch
STOP.
Your chances at dating sit at ZERO!
Jesus, man.

#OP
I GOT AN EMAIL FROM DENKOOOOO!!
I’m too scared to open it dskald;ksa
I guess now I know why everyone said I was scary…
This is making me super tense…
I’ll go wash my face, then look at it calmly… (´･ω･`)
I think I might just have a heart attack…

#OP
Um, she said “sure”… (´･ω･`)
Is this okay? Really?
I’m so happy I could cry…
This is okay, right?
I’m so stunned, I need your opinion…

#OP
She followed it up with “Don’t email me anymore.”
What’s this? And here I thought I knew her feelings…

Maybe dating was too sudden?
It’s hard for me to tell what girls are trying to get at… (´･ω･`)
Is there someone else? Is this the fickle heart of a woman at work???
What’s the intent of this email? Someone interpret it… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Maybe “sure” was in reply to the McDonald’s teriyaki burger, so “don’t email me anymore” was in reply to the confession.

Which means you’re not dating.

#2ch
^ I like this interpretation.

#2ch
Well, let’s see..

"Your emails are freaking me out.
You’re an annoyance.
Please don’t send any more emails.”

…That seems about right.

#OP
If I’m understanding the situation right, I asked if we could date, and she replied selfishly to test me as a man? (´･ω･`)

But I mean, suddenly asking not to email her is REALLY selfish…
Maybe I should wait until her anger has settled?
Or should I try to calm her?

#2ch
No. Stop.
You’re not dating.
You asked “let’s date,” she replied “don’t email me anymore.”

#OP
Okay, I’ll call her, then.
Calling now.

#OP
Nope, guess she’s talking with someone… (´･ω･`)
I’ll wait a bit…

#2ch
oh god

#2ch
OBVIOUSLY SHE’S TELLING HER FRIENDS ABOUT HER NEW BOYFRIEND

#2ch
^ Bingo!

#2ch
^ You, sir, know the heart of a woman well.

#2ch
No doubt she’s waiting for you to call.
Try calling back once every minute.

#OP
I’m redialing as fast as I can! (´･ω･`)

Once I get a hold of her, I’ll ask if she wants to go to McDonald’s to have the teriyaki burger, and ask why she’s mad. (´･ω･`)
Anything else I should talk to her about?

#OP
No good, she’s still talking… (´･ω･`)
I really feel like she’s mad at me all of a sudden…

I’ll keep calling until she comes on!
I’ll report once she does. (´･ω･`) Bye!

#2ch
I’m really starting to read the “Help!” in the title as Denko’s screaming.

#OP
I can’t get a signal here… (´･ω･`)
Maybe she’s gotten wrapped up in some incident? What to do…

Maybe I’ll go to her house, but if we’re dating, then it’s not stalking, okay?! (´･ω･`)
I’m so lost…
Maybe she’s testing to see if I’d come to save her if something happened?

#2ch
We’ve got a Sherlock Holmes on our hands.

#2ch
Spoilers: Denko is wrapped up in an incident, all right. A stalking incident.

#OP
Make up your minds already! (´･ω･`)
Making me overthink this isn’t going to do any good…

I’m going to get ready so I can leave anytime…

#OP
Okay, okay! I’ll go!!
If she’s safe, then it’ll be fine! (´･ω･`)
It’s about 30 minutes to her house, so I’ll take my bicycle.
I’ll report back! Thanks for the advice!

#OP
I just got back, sorry for the late report… (´･ω･`)

I hurried to Denko’s house and rang the doorbell.
Then Denko’s mother came out and said Denko was out of the house.
I introduced myself to her and told her I was going out with Denko, so she said “If you want, you can wait and have some tea until Denko gets back.”
So then I waited for Denko at her house with her mom… (´･ω･`)

#OP
I spent about ten hours talking with Denko’s mother about Denko in high school and her personality and such, but she didn’t come home.
Denko’s mother called her cellphone a bunch of times, but she couldn’t get through.
Late at night, she told me “I’ll give you a call when Denko comes home,” and so I went home. Sorry for the long explanation. (´･ω･`)
Apparently Denko’s out having fun with a friend, so I’m relieved to hear she’s okay.
Also, Denko’s mother was just as nice as her, which surprised me.
I guess she takes after her mother… (´･ω･`)
So now I’m waiting for a call about Denko coming home.

#OP
It looks like Denko still isn’t back…
If the thread’s still here when she gets back, I’ll report in… (´･ω･`) 

#Second thread
The second thread of the saga from 2ch. Make sure to read the first thread. (Posts from the thread-starter are labeled #OP, the people replying to him are labeled #2ch.)

#OP
I don’t have any romantic experience, so I’m not too sure, but this girl I just started dating yesterday emailed me saying not to email her.
And now I can’t get a hold of her. What do you think it could be? (´･ω･`)
Was there an incident? Is she fickle? Did she have an accident? Is she testing me?
Like I said, I’m not experienced, so please give me advice.

#2ch
(´･ω･`) Are you sure you were dating to begin with?

#OP
No, we’re definitely dating! (´･ω･`)
I’ve been in the same class as her since high school, and we went to the same college, and became friends over email.
And just yesterday we started dating! (´･ω･`)
I’ve never been on a date with a girl before, so I’m not sure what to think…

#2ch
First things first, shoot her some emails. About 600 should be good.

#2ch
DON’T EMAIL HER!!!

#2ch
Um, just wondering… is this “girlfriend” little more than a figment of your imagination?

#OP
Well, I confessed to her and she said “sure,” but right afterward she said not to email her.
Even I don’t fully understand the situation… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Going off of these other replies… yeah, you’re a stalker.
She only unwillingly said yes because she was terrified of you.

#OP
I’VE ONLY SENT 70 EMAILS SO FAR.
I had plans to call her yesterday, so I’m just confused… (´･ω･`)
Maybe I should call her house?

#2ch
Getting 70 emails in a day from someday I don’t like would bring me to gross sobbing.

#2ch
ARE YOU THE 600-EMAIL GUY FROM YESTERDAY?

#2ch
Didn’t she say she was busy with work?
Go ask her work about it.

#2ch
Somebody explain what happened yesterday, after the part where he didn’t know his brother’s contact info.

#2ch
^ OP emailed Denko a ton.
She didn’t reply, he confessed his love.
Right after, Denko replied “sure.”
But it was apparently a reply from before the confession, and afterward he got an email saying “don’t email me anymore.”
And yet, in the OP’s mind, Denko is already his girlfriend.

#2ch
Are you for real?
If I was Denko, I’d be horrified and depressed.

#2ch
Who has the time to reply to that many emails?
Think about her feelings, you dick.

#2ch
(´･ω･`) What is this guy even talking about?

#2ch
Denko’s crying her eyes out.

#OP
Other than being a virgin, I’m a relatively ordinary guy. (´･ω･`)
Is there any way to force her into getting in contact with me?
I went to her house once and talked with her mother, and she said she’d call once Denko came home.
But I’m uneasy since it seems like she still isn’t home…

#2ch
Ordinary guys… don’t send 600 emails in three days when there’s no reply…

#OP
I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT, OKAY.
I realized it was a bit excessive after you all told me so… (´･ω･`)
I’ve sent 70 emails so far, but that’s just one every ten minutes, so I think I’m good… (´･ω･`)

#OP
I’m waiting at a cafe near her house to see if she passes by, but I haven’t seen her.
It’s in front of the station that goes to school, so she must take this route…

I just want to know the truth in this unclear situation…
I like her so much, but I feel like I’ve been betrayed… (´･ω･`)

[The love letter is reposted and someone requests the previous thread be summarized, so it is.]

#2ch
This just makes me feel terrible.
I feel so sorry for that girl.

#2ch
I don’t think she said “sure” to the confession. Who would say “sure” to that?

#OP
Come ooon, guys, stop calling me creepy!
I know you like to joke around, but I’m heartbroken here, so I’m taking it seriously… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
You’re too self-conscious.
Try a little harder and she’ll see your love.

#2ch
Sorry, but I wasn’t joking.
YOU ARE A HORRIBLE, DISGUSTING CREEP.

#2ch
gOD

#2ch
That thread from yesterday…?
Are you really the same guy?
And what do you mean you “went on a date”?
Tell me what “happened” there.

#2ch
So he never got his brother’s address, huh?
If he can’t get in contact with his brother, OP is done. DONE.

#OP
I asked my mother for my brother’s phone number yesterday, but he doesn’t seem to want to talk to me.
Talk about rude! We’re family… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
When’s your birthday, OP? She might be preparing a surprise! Consider it!

#OP
It’s March 10th… [Which was about a month ago.]

What do you guys do when you fight with your girlfriends?
I’d like to know for reference… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Have you tried waiting in front of her house?
Make sure to hide so no one sees you.

#OP
Of course I thought about doing that, but I decided against it, since really, isn’t that stalkery?
So I decided to wait for her in the cafe instead… (´･ω･`)
No matter what road she takes, she’ll pass through here, so she can’t go anywhere.

#2ch
And you think sending 600 emails in a couple days isn’t stalkery…

#2ch
Well, I’m a girl… Did you actually fight?
Some girls will get mad and say “I’m mad! Don’t email me!”, so she might be indirectly telling you she’s mad.

#OP
I figured she might be mad…
But, well, do girls sometimes fake being mad to see if their boyfriends really love them? (´･ω･`)

#2ch
His brother’s a former actor, FYI.
Assuming he’s not just making that up, I deeply pity that man…

Soon enough, he’s going to have to apologize for his relative’s crimes.

#OP
I SAID I’M NOT A STALKER!
Haven’t any of you ever waited for a girl you’re not dating?
And a husband who waits for his wife at the station isn’t a stalker, is he?

When I meet her, I think it might be best not to harshly question her or get mad, but to calmly embrace her… (´･ω･`)
Advice, pleeease…

#2ch
ROFL

#2ch
Uh, maybe if you have mutual trust…
But even if you’re lovers, stalking is stalking!
If a boyfriend or girlfriend gets stalkery, the other will want to break up…

#2ch
Man! She’s totally waiting for you to come meet her!
She doesn’t want you to email her or call her, just to come by, so forget it!
She’s testing you for sure.
Take up her challenge!

#OP
I guess you’re right. (´･ω･`)
I’ll try going to her house! Thanks for the advice!

#OP
Well, actually, I’m fifty-fifty on going or not going now that I think about it… (´･ω･`)
I’ve been sort of panicking since yesterday, so I can’t tell which is the right thing to do.

If I’m really a stalker like you say, then what will happen to my relationship with Denko? I’m scared…

#2ch
Is there even a “relationship” between you?
Or is it just a lot of her hating you?

#2ch
Ignore these dumbass trolls who say you’re not dating, or that you’re a stalker.
That’s just the kind of tripe you get on 2chan.
Send her another 50 emails, buddy.

#2ch
You should go!
She’s just being shy.

#OP
Sorry I haven’t been replying much, but I’m just thinking I might miss her passing the station while I’m typing…

#OP
Okay, I made the trip! (´･ω･`)
It looks like I’m not going to get everything cleared up unless I meet her in person.

Going to ring the doorbell now…

#OP
I rang the doorbell, but nobody showed up.
I realized it might be possible her mom was out and she was in the bath.
And we haven’t kissed yet, so seeing her naked already would probably be rude… (´･ω･`)
Plus I concluded that even if she came out in a bathrobe, I’d never seen a girl like that before, so I wouldn’t be able to talk well.
So finally, I thought I’d leave a note in the mailbox.
I bought some paper at the store and I’m thinking about what to write… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
If you’re writing a letter, you better include a bouquet with it.

#2ch
If she doesn’t want to say anything mean, then I’ll have to. Just… get away from her, now.
Ugh. Christ.

#2ch
A long time ago, I got my girlfriend mad over a little thing, and just like the OP, she yelled at me not to contact her.
So I went straight to her house, apologized sincerely, hugged her, and patted her head.
After that, we had a good meal, drank at a fancy bar, and everything was just dandy.

First things first, hug her and pat her head, and make sure to apologize.
Good luck, Mr. Boyfriend!

#OP
I GOT AN EMAIL BUT I’M TOO SCARED TO OPEN IT.
What if she says she’s breaking up with me? (´･ω･`)
My hands are trembling at the negative things it could be…

#OP
Subject: Were you at my house?

Contents:
N/A

D… Does this mean she was in the bath and couldn’t come to the door? (´･ω･`)
Then was I wise to look into the house, but avoid the bathroom in case things went awry?

#2ch
Come on, lover boy, you’re lovers!
Tell her you came by to see Denko’s hot bod.
Gotta have humor in a lasting relationship, man.

#2ch
You’re hiding in your house, Denko…?
You poor thing… I hope she has a friend to stay beside her…

#2ch
Subject: I was!
Contents: I was worried that I couldn’t contact you, my beloved Denko.
Since we’re dating now, I just wanted to see your face, you know?
Well, I’m still very close by, so can we stick together today?

Go with that.
Gotta be natural inviting her on a date. Flow like water.

#OP
Thanks! My brain doesn’t work when I’m panicking like this, so that’s a big help.
I’ll send that.

#OP
You know, I rang the doorbell a bunch of times thinking Denko wasn’t there…
Do you think she thinks I’m rude? (´･ω･`)

#2ch
You’re done, dude.

#2ch
Mashing the doorbell, dear god…
This is a troll, right? Just tell me, I can’t take it.

#2ch
I’m seriously scared right now…

#2ch
- Stupid emoticon
- Late-ass replies
- Doesn’t know what the hell
- Ignores actually useful replies
- Sounds like a dumbass

This guy pisses me off.

#2ch
^ SOUNDS like a dumbass?

#OP
Waiting for her reply for now. (´･ω･`)
Romance is making for a rollercoaster of emotions…
I’ve never had such huge shifts in feelings before.
You’re the only real people I can talk with since I don’t have friends, but I’ve glad I have you.
Thanks to those who are supporting me and giving advice… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
I can tell Denko’s just tsundere, man.
Gotta embrace her to bring out that dere, OP.

#OP
I’m late saying this, but I went back to Denko’s house.
Since I got an email, I figure she must be out of the bath by now… (´･ω･`)

Well, I’ll report once we meet! Buh-bye!

#2ch
Eep…

#OP
Sorry, I needed time to figure out the situation…
I went to Denko’s house, rang the doorbell, and Denko’s mom came out.
And she said “If you come by again, I’ll call the police!”
Which of these do you think it could be?

A: Denko’s mother is opposed to me and Denko going out.
B: Her mother misinterprets me as being a stalker.
C: She’s mad about me ringing a bunch of times earlier.

Those are the three possibilities I can think of… (´･ω･`)
I’m still kind of shocked her mom’s mad at me…

#2ch
Or D: Denko has you pinned as a stalker.
If she’s as cute as you say, she must have a boyfriend.
You gotta embrace her as hard as you can to relieve her.

#2ch
Better email Denko to make sure.

#2ch
Don’t you already know, deep down inside?
Little Denko’s just being shy!
Hah, her mother must be misunderstanding why she’s red-faced in her room…
Explain it to her and she’ll understand!

#2ch
D: Her mom isn’t misunderstanding, you ARE a stalker.

Because, you know. You are.

#OP
For now, I’m calling Denko’s cellphone.
If I don’t talk to her soon, there are only going to be more misunderstandings.

If she thinks I’m weird too, I’m gonna feel terrible… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
uuuggGGGHHHH WHY DO YOU NOT REALIZE YOU WERE DONE AFTER SENDING HER 600 EMAILS????????

#OP
I can’t stop crying over how miserable I am… (´･ω･`)
I’m crying looking into the computer screen, but still thinking about passersby giving me weird looks, which makes me cry even more…
Love really is hard…

#OP
I think crying it all out helped.
Thinking about it, Denko hasn’t said anything to me straight.
So it’s her mother who’s shady… (´･ω･`)
But if she calls the police, my life is over, so I need a way to meet Denko without involving her mom…

#2ch
Stake out behind her house.
If Denko comes to the window, knock on it and you’re good.

#OP
I don’t want to take unnecessary risks.
Really, waiting in front of the station is best, but I think I’ll lose if it’s a war of attrition… (´･ω･`)
But something similarly romantic to what the guy above me said might be good…

#2ch
It’s like goddamn Romeo and Juliet, man.
You can even throw rocks if Denko’s room is on the second floor.

#OP
Gonna go check Denko’s house! Buh-bye!

#2ch
SHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHIT

#2ch
Don’t tell me OP was arrested… was he?

#2ch
POLICE END. I knew it.

#2ch
GJ, OP! I look forward to your next work!

#OP
Back home for now. (´･ω･`)

I went to her house and looked for Denko’s room.
I saw a curtain move inside, so I peeked behind it and met eyes with Denko.
Then she immediately screamed “MOM!!” and I instinctively fled.
So yeah, I’m at home now… (´；ω；`)

#2ch
Damn, dude, you’re done. Give yourself up.

#2ch
Man, why did you RUN?

Think about how SHE feels!

#OP
Isn’t it awful? I just don’t get it…
Am I being played with? Why does the person most important to me have to trample on my feelings?
I know that all her feelings must have turned to hate now…
She’s really getting upset with me… (´･ω･`)
I punched a wall really hard and now my hand hurts too… This is the worst…

#2ch
If it were me, I’d go back and make sure to talk with her. Or better yet, give her a letter written in my own blood.
Write in your own blood and she’ll know it’s true.

#2ch
^ Now THAT’s romantic.

#OP
Contents:
Don’t call me or email me anymore, please.
I’m sorry, but I’m really, really scared.
If there’s been a misunderstanding, then I apologize.
But this is my last email. Please don’t contact me again, I’m begging you.

What does this mean…? (´･ω･`)
I’ve been thinking about it for a good while now and I’m just not sure…

#2ch
It means “DON’T CONTACT ME EVER AGAIN FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.”

#2ch
Her mother is a wicked woman.
Don’t be fooled, OP.

#2ch
You’re still only banned from phone calls and emails.
Do you have a carrier pigeon?

#2ch
>Don’t call me or email me anymore, please.
In short, don’t associate with her.

>I’m sorry, but I’m really, really scared.
She’s afraid of the things you’re doing.

>If there’s been a misunderstanding, then I apologize.
You apparently think Denko likes you, OP, but she doesn’t like you at all.

#2ch
You’re being tested, OP.

Are you really going to give up here?

Is this truly the extent of your love?

#2ch
OP’s love is so pure, I don’t think I could possibly imitate it.

#2ch
I’m guessing this is what the OP thinks:

>Don’t call me or email me anymore, please.
She wants to meet me in person! (´･ω･`)
>I’m sorry, but I’m really, really scared.
Denko must be in danger… I’ve got to help her! (´･ω･`)
>If there’s been a misunderstanding, then I apologize.
We’ve repaired our friendship. Now we’ll always be together! (´･ω･`)
>But this is my last email. Please don’t contact me again, I’m begging you.
Yep, definitely wants to meet in person! (´･ω･`)

#2ch
^ Terrifyingly… accurate…

#OP
My mind is a blank.
What does Denko want to become of our relationship?
I want to meet her face to face, but…
Oh, and my power cut out again… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
So, this is a troll, right?
If not, then go turn yourself in to the police, OP.

#2ch
This has taught me a lot about the mentality of a stalker.

#OP
I AM SO AFRAID OF DENKO REJECTING ME. (´･ω･`)
At this point, I’m not sure if it’s possible to get the happy end that everyone wants…

I’m trying to think of an email to send Denko, but my mind’s been a blank.

#2ch
Don’t send anything.

If you see her at school, tell her you’re really sorry for troubling her! Okay?!

#2ch
What everyone wants is Denko’s safety.
Just leave Denko alone.
She must be so confused…

#2ch
That… everyone… wants…

#2ch
Uh. What everyone wants is OP BEHIND BARS!!

#2ch
"The happy end that everyone wants"…? What planet does this kid live on?

#OP
All you guys hating me is getting annoying…
I’m afraid I might be brainwashed by this place… (´･ω･`)
I’m going to ignore 2ch’s opinions and write an email with my heartfelt feelings!

#2ch
If you like Denko, then don’t send it. I’m serious.

Stop giving her reasons to despise you!

#2ch
And he doesn’t even know why he was bullied in school.

#OP
Subject: This Is How I Feel

Contents:
I’m sorry for making you worry.
I would never consider killing or raping you, Denko, so don’t worry. Is that what you thought I would do?
Now, I want you to take what I’m saying seriously.
I really, truly love you, Denko.
I think I would be willing to die for you, Denko.
I’ve always been trying to ensure your happiness first.
And I don’t think my feelings for you will ever change.
It’s very unfortunate things got like this right after we started dating, but we can start over.
That would be great, wouldn’t it?
Remember what I said when I confessed to you?
I still feel the way I did back then…

Well, I sent this. (´･ω･`)

#2ch
PERFECTION.

#2ch
Oh christ, that first part will give me nightmares.
Even if this is just a troll, it’s horrifying that you can even THINK of that!

#2ch
Speaking as a girl, I would absolutely call the police if I got this.

#OP
If there’s any further developments, I’ll make another thread.
Still waiting for Denko to reply now. (´･ω･`)
Thanks for everyone who’s given support!
Keep watching over us as we work toward happiness!!
Thank you! I’m so grateful!

#Third thread
The third thread of the saga from 2ch. Make sure to start from the first thread. (Posts from the thread-starter are labeled #OP, the people replying to him are labeled #2ch.)

#OP
I was going out with my girlfriend Denko, but she suddenly told me we’re not dating… (´･ω･`)
Does this mean we’ve broken up?

#2ch
They…
They haven’t arrested you yet?

#2ch
You’re STILL here?

Forget about Denko. I feel so bad for her.

#OP
Hey, this is no laughing matter!
I made this thread so I could sort things out inside before I went to meet Denko today.

This is how things went:
I confessed -> Denko gave me the okay -> Denko said don’t email her -> Denko wasn’t dating me to begin with
I guess? I don’t understand it at all… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Show us that supposed “okay” email. In full, no editing.

#OP
Me: “I love you, please go out with me!” (Abbreviated)
Denko: “Sure” (Non-abbreviated)

#OP
She suddenly changed her phone number and email address, so now I can’t contact her, as much as I want to…
Plus there are strange rumors spreading about me at school, and everyone’s ignoring me… (´･ω･`)
It hurts so much…

#2ch
gg, man.

But it could still be worse.
On top of changing her phone number and email to get away from you, she could have you checked into a mental institution.

#OP
Please! This is a huge shock to me!
I can’t believe Denko would do something like this…
Because just yesterday, one of Denko’s school friends sold me her new email and phone number for 60,000 yen… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Same guy, huh… Frankly, I’m amazed he’s still around.

#2ch
Wait a sec.
I saw the old threads, but OP, did you really send over 600 emails without getting a reply?

#OP
I didn’t have any experience with romance, so yes, I sent that many.
But I’m better now that everyone’s warned against me doing that… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
That’s dedication, man.

But what would you do if Denko liked someone else?

#OP
I don’t think that would happen, but if she got another boyfriend, I’d cry… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
She doesn’t want your love, so pretending to date Denko is just troubling her.
It’s a waste of time getting so attached.

#OP
If I got another girlfriend, what would I tell Denko?
What would be the point of that?

#2ch
Haha, this is funny…
I just woke up my girlfriend who was sleeping beside me, had her read the previous threads… and now she can’t sleep anymore.

#2ch
Given the title of the thread, don’t you already know it’s time to give up?

#2ch
^ Let’s be realistic here, he didn’t have a girlfriend at any point.

#2ch
So, did you end up getting a reply from Denko?

#OP
After I sent that message, Denko changed her number and address, and the next day her friend sold them to me.
Then I tried sending another email, but she’d changed her number yet again.
I was really upset and bought the info from her friend again, but when I finally emailed Denko, she said we’re not dating… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
So the current situation is she said you’re not dating, so you want to talk about what you should do?

#OP
Well, Denko seems to be denying me her email, so I changed my address and I’m pretending to be one of her friends…
I need a way to casually ask what she thinks about me in a conversation… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Can you just throw in a casual “Is the thing with (OP) going okay?” with a regular email?

#OP
Hmm… (´･ω･`) I might send that, sure…
But I’m not sure if she’d talk to her friends about it, and she might already be asleep…

#2ch
You’d better not email her right now.
Don’t blow your relationship at this point, man.

#2ch
Maybe around 500 emails would wake her up?

#OP
Then she’d definitely know it was me! (´･ω･`) Pleeeeease…

#2ch
Be frank with her, man!
Then the conversation can flow naturally.

Do you have a boyfriend?
-> YES
"Ooh, who is it?" (If OP’s name comes up, you’re safe.)

-> NO
"Didn’t someone confess to you, though? Who was that?"
Then you can ask what you want to hear about yourself, OP.

Abruptly asking if she likes or hates you would be a mistake.
Lead the conversation toward what you want to hear.

#OP
Whoa! Thanks! That’s really useful!!!
Lead the conversation, huh? I think I’ll send her an email now.
Earlier I said “It’s ___! I changed my address, so please add me!!”
Denko: “___ from ___? Gotcha! Sorry, I just changed addresses too.
Invite me if you go out drinking again!”

#2ch
Good morning! Sorry to message you now.
I just woke up at this weird time…
Before I get back to bed, I was just thinking…
Denko, you’re really popular, right? So do you have a boyfriend?

Maybe start with something like that?

#OP
Thanks, I sent that. (´･ω･`)

#2ch
If she actually replies at a time like this, I think I’ll fall for Denko’s sweetness.

#OP
I’ve been wanting to know when Denko sleeps, so I’ve watched her window to see when the lights go out.
Usually the lights are out around 1 or 2, so she might be sleeping… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
OP, what about Denko charms you?

#OP
She’s cute, and tidy, and kind, and though she’s a little timid, she tries hard when she wants to.
She’s always putting in lots of effort in the shadows… (´･ω･`)
She’s just so delicate and pure. And she has a strong sense of justice, so she hates twisted things.

#2ch
So basically, Denko would be murdered if this were a TV drama.

#2ch
^ Isn’t that backwards?
As a result of OP being constantly rejected, he kills Denko out of spite…
Please, recognize you were never dating to begin with.

#OP
I HAVE HAD NO INTENTION OF KILLING OR RAPING HER.
I just wish things would go back to normal… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
And what was “normal,” again?

#OP
Just mutually caring for one another? (´･ω･`)
It sounds embarrassing when I write it…

#2ch
And how exactly did that mutual caring go?

#OP
Specifically? Uh, we emailed each other, I put smiley faces on things…
We made lots of eye contact, I greeted her with a smile… I’m getting embarrassed, but yeah, it was a lot of things.

#OP
Since everyone’s warned me that I send too many emails, I’ll only send ten every three days… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Strong sense of justice? Hates twisted things? Wow, she must hate your guts.

#2ch
Take heart, everyone. There’s no mistaking that OP and Denko never “mutually cared for” each other.

#OP
I guess it’s just hard to explain our relationship to a third party… (´･ω･`)
It’s something only we could understand, okay?

#2ch
You’re still at this…
There’s other fish in the sea, and dating sites and all that.
If Denko is eaten up by jealousy, then fine, go back to Denko.
But if not, then get along with your new girl.

#OP
I COULDN’T HAVE ANYONE BESIDES DENKO. DENKO’S THE ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD I COULD LOVE.

#2ch
»Changed her number and email address
»Changed her number and email address
»Changed her number and email address
»Changed her number and email address
»Changed her number and email address
»Changed her number and email address
…Does he… not notice…
What boyfriend wouldn’t be told about a new phone number and email…?

#2ch
He has no friends, and no experience with women, so this is how he thinks…
Make some friends first. Then we’ll talk.

#OP
I would say I don’t need friends as long as I have Denko.
But then again, I think of you guys as friends… (´･ω･`)
Since you’re all so experienced and giving me good advice…

#2ch
This guy is a serious pain in the ass.

#2ch
Why don’t you meet her face to face?
Then she’ll definitely know how barf-worthy you are.

#OP
I WANT TO BUT THEY MIGHT CALL THE POLICE.
I’ve keeping watch in front of the train station, but I’m suspecting she changed her route… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Confessing over email is so middle school…
Why can’t you tell her directly?

#2ch
Can’t you ask Denko’s friends who sold you her email?

#OP
Yeah, I’ve heard from her friend…
Supposedly Denko is “seriously afraid I’ll murder her someday.”
But I don’t think I can trust them…
It’s important I see the truth with my own ears and eyes… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Okay, just for the sake of argument.

If Denko got a boyfriend and said “OP, you’re creepy as hell, never show yourself to me again!!!!”, what would you do?

Totally hypothetical.

#OP
I guess first I’d ask what she doesn’t like about me? And then I’d try my best to be a guy that satisfies Denko.

#2ch
You’re always… keeping watch…?!

#2ch
She’ll call the police if you go to her house.
You’re keeping watch for her in front of the train station.
You suspect she changed her route.
And you still think she likes you?

#OP
Do you think there’s a misunderstanding?
I just want things cleared up… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Okay, serious time!
OP, you’re pretending to be one of her friends over email, yeah?
Then casually invite her out to karaoke.
Be a little late, send “I’m gonna be late, so you should go in before me!”
Then OP goes into the room, and you’re golden.
Since it’s karaoke, you’ll be good even if she screams! Good luck!

#2ch
I don’t suppose this “Denko” might be little more than a figment of your imagination?
If that’s the case, I don’t think there’s any doubt you have schizophrenia.
Or perhaps “Denko” does exist, but all the outrageous events you write of here are completely wild fantasies.
If that’s the case… I still don’t think there’s any doubt you have schizophrenia.

Okay, maybe I’m way off the mark, but I’m just noting the possibility.
You don’t get anything but what they write on 2channel, but it’s worth thinking about.

#2ch
If Denko figures out it’s the OP emailing her, she’s going to go insane.

#OP
I’m planning to get the info and make a quick getaway.
I don’t think I’ll get caught… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
It’s inevitable, dude.
Do you want her to hate you even more?

#2ch
Denko’s sleeping right beside me.
Her slot was too loose, so she took it up the ass.

#OP
DENKO’S NO WHORE YOU WON’T FOOL ME

#OP
Apparently Denko and some of her friends are going to see the cherry blossoms in Yoyogi Park tomorrow.
I might be able to see Denko from afar, while she’s distracted by the blossoms.
But I could use your advice to make sure I don’t do anything wrong… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
How did you find this out?

#OP
Denko’s friend sold me the info for 3000 yen… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Oh, right. Is that friend who’s selling you info a boy or a girl?

#OP
She’s a girl, but don’t worry, I know I can’t trust her 100%. (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Having to pay for information isn’t making you lose heart?
What would Denko have to say to make you give up??

#OP
I think I’m being very faithful by going as far as paying to know more about Denko.
Giving up at this point would be unthinkable, so I’m not thinking about it.
Because I really don’t know what I would do.

#2ch
Ignoring that this could be a complete troll, Denko’s a real good kid.

I mean, she actually gave the time of day to OP despite him being bullied all his life and still being a creeper even in college.

#2ch
What was this confession email you sent, OP?

[Love letter reposted.]

#OP
H-Hey, guys, stop posting that, it’s embarrassing!
I think things are really going to make progress this afternoon.
No replies since Denko seems to be asleep… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
You should just casually greet her today.

And since it’s hot, you can give her some juice.

#OP
I’ve been thinking about just casually showing up, yeah…
And then meeting Denko in person under the cherry blossoms so I can confess once more… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Er, do you think suddenly running into you would make Denko happy?

#OP
Was it accident or fate that me and Denko met on this earth?
I got the information she was going flower-viewing from a friend, so maybe that could be fate?
And Denko might just realize how fated our meeting is… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
(゜Д゜)

#2ch
Are you going to check to see if Denko leaves on time?

#2ch
I would think this is a troll for sure, but that guy who got arrested a while ago was for real…
There are some serious crazies in the world.

#2ch
Details on guy who got arrested?

#2ch
There was a stalker thread by some art student going on about such-and-such his true love.
Everyone thought he was a troll, but then he got arrested.

#2ch
^ It was Minami.

#2ch
^ Wait, that was real?!

#2ch
Here’s how things are going to go down:
- He’s rejected or reported
- Isn’t it awful that she tramples on my pure feelings?
- How can she not understand that I love her so? Never forgive…
- Denko gets shanked

#2ch
^ JESUS CRHIST NOOOOO
DENKO RUN AWAY

#2ch
I knew a guy who got rejected five times for “not being their type,” but the sixth dated him.
I asked the girl why he dated him, and she seemed to honestly like his determination.
Incidentally, it was the girl’s first boyfriend, so she was worrying a lot about dating, but she fell for the guy’s fierce forwardness.
No reason for OP to give in! So good luck and don’t stab her!

#OP
Whoa! That sounds exactly like me and Denko right now!
That really gives me hope!

#2ch
I wonder what Denko looks like.
Is she cute?
Being targeted by a stalker can’t be good for her mental state, though.

#OP
Yeah, she’s cute, though I don’t know if I could compare her to any celebrities since I don’t really know any…
I guess you could call her the model Japanese beauty.

#2ch
Hm…
And her height? I bet she’s skinny.

#OP
She’s right around 150 cm and yeah, has a slender figure… (´･ω･`)
And she’s a virign. (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Wait, how do you know she’s a virgin.
Did she tell you that herself?

#OP
Um, I just have a feeling she is…? I mean, I KNOW Denko couldn’t possibly be such a loose girl… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Pfft, you’re guessing…?
Well, who wouldn’t believe OP’s got a sixth sense for this stuff?

#2ch
I’m really sorry, dude.

#2ch
Denko might develop a fear of men at this rate.
And why the hell did Denko’s friend give OP info?
Even to make a quick buck, that’s being the worst friend ever…

#2ch
This is definitely reminding me of the Minami thread.

#2ch
Somebody call for a Snake?
I’ll go.

#2ch
^ Please protect Denko.

#2ch
^ You are our ray of light.

#2ch
Where does OP live?

#2ch
Same class as Denko in high school.
They both live with their parents.
College friends going flower-viewing in Yoyogi Park.
Given that stuff, I’m thinking they both live in the city.
And if it’s the Chuo line, I think the college is between Shinjuku and Mitaka.
If it were any lower than that, I don’t think they’d go to Yoyogi for flower-viewing.

#OP
Still not here… (´･ω･`)
Which means not much to write. If I get an email, I expect some advice.

#2ch
By the way, this is what he sent as a followup to the rejection email after peeking through windows for Denko.
[Repost of “Subject: This Is How I Feel.”]

#2ch
He explicitly denied wanting to “kill her or rape her”…
If this is real, that’s nightmarish…

#OP
Guys, don’t come look for me! That’d be embarrassing!
You’ll make me laugh if I see you while I’m confessing…

#2ch
What are you going to go in, a suit?

#OP
Just pants and a shirt… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
What do you think the chances of your confession succeeding are?

#OP
Honestly, probably about fifty-fifty… But I know she’s going to accept! I believe!

#2ch
Poor Denko’s gonna have PTSD.

#OP
Not to spoil anything, but I do have a special backup plan…
I’ll have one of Denko’s friends ask her to buy some alcohol.
Then while Denko is alone, I call to her and bring her under the cherry blossoms. (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Ooh, what a schemer!
Make sure she doesn’t hurt herself when she swoons.

#2ch
You got some real great friends, Denko… lololol

#2ch
Has all the info so far been correct?

#OP
The info I got from Denko’s friend? So far, I guess…
But I still don’t trust her 100%.

#2ch
Where’d OP go?

#2ch
Probably school.

His priorities are all out of whack, but in a way it makes me envious…

#OP
Actually, I’ve been ignoring college. They all call me creepy, so I’ve stopped going… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
If you’re gonna make a thread, answer your damn questions!

Seriously, what an aspie…

#OP
I’m not an “aspie,” okay? I’ll answer anything!
But sorry if I overlook anything… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
So the only info you’ve gotten from the friend is Denko’s contact info and the info about today?

#OP
No, she’s already sold me a bunch of other info.
Like the other day, Denko went with a friend to a soap store and bought some honey-scented body soap.
So now I’m using the exact same stuff as Denko… (´･ω･`)

#OP
And please don’t do this Snake thing, okay?
My entire life is riding on today’s confession, so I’m terrified of someone getting in the way… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Just one thing I want to ask OP.
If Denko’s with a boyfriend at the park, will you stab her?

#OP
She definitely doesn’t have one so it’ll be okay. (´･ω･`)

#OP
Ack! Apparently I’m being misunderstood again!
The reason I’m using the same body soap is just because I thought it might help me know Denko’s feelings and make me think about things.
So it’s not for gross reasons or anything…

#OP
OHMYGODOHMYGOD I GOT AN EMAIL FROM DENKO!!!!
I’M GONNA EXPLOOOODE!!!
Gonna wash my face first like usual!

#OP
Subject: N/A
Contents:
"…? Is this ___?" (My name)

…I think this is the first time I’ve experienced synchronicity…

#2ch
Busteeeeed.

#OP
How did she find me out…? (´･ω･`)
I’m thinking how to reply…
Please, I need a way to avert this crisis…

#2ch
It was probably one of these two:

- What you were sending her (that damn emoticon?)
- She got an email from her real friend

Haha, gonna have to get serious now…

#2ch
This is tough…
She’s clever.
I don’t know how you could reply to keep up the charade.

"Hm? ___?? What about him?"
That’s the best I’ve got…

#OP
You’re all so mean… (´･ω･`)
For now, I sent ^ that email.

#OP
I’m feeling so depressed… (´･ω･`)
Well, for the people supporting me, I’ll keep you up to date on the results of the flower-viewing! Buh-bye! 

#Fourth thread
Part four of the saga from 2ch. Make sure to start from the first thread. (Posts from the thread-starter are labeled #OP, the people replying to him are labeled #2ch.)

#OP
I’m being tested by this girl I’m dating…
How’s a guy supposed to react to this kind of thing? Tell me, somebody… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
…Denko guy? Is that you?

#OP
Yes. Sorry I’m late with my report. (´･ω･`)
I was successful in coming into contact with Denko on Friday, but a bunch of other things happened… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
yoU… AGAIN…

#OP
First, I paid Denko’s friend 20,000 yen to make sure my plan went smoothly.
I asked her to request Denko to go buy alcohol.
And then finally, finally I saw Denko again! (´･ω･`)
I didn’t want to suddenly call her, so to display my passion as her boyfriend, I snuck up from behind and hugged her… (´･ω･`)

#OP
Denko’s body felt so warm… (´･ω･`)
It might have just been the best moment of my life. I don’t think I’m going to wash these clothes, so I don’t forget.
Denko was surprised too, and let out a really loud shriek and ran, but I wasn’t going to have that again!
I grabbed her arm so she couldn’t run. Because I wanted to hear her true feelings… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
I’ve seen scenes like this in horror films about serial killers…

#OP
Denko was really hollering, so her friends got worried.
And she said she was going home for the day. And they all told me not to come near Denko again… (´･ω･`)

I HOPE SHE REPLIES SOON (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Have you asked her how she felt after that?

#OP
Well, I’d rather have advice on how to do that than do something clumsy…
That’s why I made a thread, so I could ask you guys… (´･ω･`)

#OP
Denko, you’ve been so much trouble to deal with… I’m exhausted.
I want to talk it out with her, but I need help on how I should go about it… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Dear god, this guy is even more of a crazy than I thought.

#2ch
Poor, poor Denko…

#2ch
Are you still emailing her pretending to be her friend?

#2ch
Seriously, still not behind bars?

#2ch
Hey…
I’m the Snake from the last thread, but, uh…
How did this happen…? I was hoping I could be reassured it was just a troll…
When did the flower-viewing start…? When was OP in Yoyogi Park…?

#2ch
^ How long were you there?

#2ch
^ From around 3 to 4:30. I couldn’t stay that long.
Two other Snakes who were there since 12 told me they didn’t see anybody like the OP.
The guests were starting to leave, so we left too. Uh, at least I got home safe…


[And the thread dies without any more OP posts. But then…]




[Help!] I’m Being Bullied At School (´･ω･`)

#OP
I’m incredibly worried, honestly…
I was bullied in grade school too, but this is just awful.
Somebody, please help me…

#2ch
![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2y328nlmZ1qgji20.png)

#2ch
Become a masochist and all your worries will melt away.

#2ch
I’ll help. Give me the name of your school, your year, and the bully’s name, phone number, and anything else you know.

#2ch
YOU AGAIN
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE FLOWER-VIEWING

#2ch
I’ll help just this once, OP.

What exactly do you want from us?

#OP
I want to know what I can do to not get bullied… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Tell us the sexual parts of your harassment, OP.

#OP
I was never bullied in my first year of college, but the bullying’s started again…
I just ignored it at first, but people are telling me I’m creepy and to die to my face.
Most of the time they pick on me by sprinkling me with toilet water.
I’m afraid it’ll be like this my whole time in college… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
I can’t help but think there’s a reason.

#2ch
I’m honestly surprised they’d do that kind of bullying in college. That’s rough. In grade school, if you’re hurt or made fun of, you could always change schools, but college…?
Is it possible you could avoid the bullies?

#OP
Thank you… (´；ω；`)
More and more rumors are spreading about me, so I’m being called names by people I don’t even know.
I wish there were some way to stop the rumors… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
denko

#OP
I was usually teased for having a timid personality, but it’s really rough getting bullied even after I’m in college…

#2ch
Bullying in college…?

#2ch
Hahaha, something seems awfully familiar about this thread…

The Denko guy???

#2ch
Getting bullied in college must mean it’s a pretty sucky college…

#2ch
You are the cause, OP. (´･ω･`)

#OP
Hey, even if there were a good reason, I shouldn’t have to put up with bullying at this age… (´･ω･`)
I’ve been skipping school a lot out of fear…

#2ch
Did you get to confess under the cherry blossoms?

#OP
Sorry, I meant to give some details about me… (´･ω･`)
I’ve never really written anything like this before, but, uh…
Hair: Tackey-esque
Face: Normal
Clothes: I don’t know much about them, but ordinary pants and shirts
Height: 170 cm, pretty normal
Personality: Quiet (´･ω･`)

Something like that…
Any advice given that?

#2ch
I was bullied once.

In my case, after a while, I didn’t give them any reaction.
And then soon enough, it stopped.
I couldn’t make friends with them, but at least I could get them to not want to bully me.

I don’t think it’s a very good idea to ditch school.
You’re just feeding them by letting them get to you.

#OP
Really???
Even skipping school counts as a reaction, huh…
What should I do… Deep down, I really want to just tell them “Stop it!!”… (´･ω･`)
Although I can’t bring myself to say it in front of them anyway.
Do I have to just put up with it for now? I do want to go to school, but it hurts…

#2ch
>Deep down, I really want to just tell them “Stop it!!”

Is that Denko speaking?

#2ch
No, you shouldn’t tell them “Stop it!” either.
If you do, they’ll just want to bully you even more.
That’s what they enjoy, and that’s why they do it.

First, you want to think of it like “Oh, this again. They just don’t give up.”
Make sure they don’t get any enjoyment out of it.

It might take about two months for it to go away for good.

By the way, what are these rumors? Where did they come from?

#OP
Ooogh… I see… (´･ω･`)
No reaction at all…
I don’t know if I can handle it, considering I was bullied in grade school too…
But two months is better than forever, I suppose…
It’s bad timing though, since I’m mentally exhausted after my girlfriend broke up with me…

I don’t really want to talk about the rumors. (´･ω･`) I’m not sure what to say about them…

#2ch
Riiight, don’t want to talk about it…
Because you’re the cause of them, right?
If I’m wrong, just tell us so, so we can give you more useful advice.

#2ch
This is the Denko guy?

#2ch
Denko’s boyfriend → (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Thought so.
He’s as bad at listening to people as ever.

#2ch
THEY BROKE UP?

#2ch
^ Not like they were dating to begin with.

#2ch
This guy’s a college student, really??
He sounds like a middle-schooler at best.

#OP
If I mentioned Denko right away, no one would reply honestly… (´･ω･`)
So I just wanted to ask about the bullying…

#2ch
LOL, the Denko guy…
Geez, I’m curious what happened with her.

#OP
Can we just have a conversation here?
I don’t have any friends, so if I can’t even talk here, I’m gonna feel really defeated… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Okay, dude, listen. Listen. LISTEN.
The previous threads were all about Denko and all that stuff, right?
And you talked about her plenty in them, but not here.
If you didn’t want Denko to come up here, then why the thread title?
It’s completely obvious you’re the same guy.

#OP
It’s a very delicate situation, so even a single word could hurt matters…
Why does everyone want to talk about Denko? Why not me?
I’m not really in a situation where I can talk about her anyway… (´･ω･`)

#OP
See, and now everyone attacks me… (´･ω･`)
I’ve noticed that whenever I talk about Denko, I get unpleasant responses.
So please consider that I’m very hurt right now and don’t want to talk about it… (´･ω･`)
Back to the bullying, I don’t want to do what’s being recommended…
I want to know a more peaceful method, because I can’t put up with this for two months…
If only things could go back to normal in a day…

#2ch
>I’ve noticed that whenever I talk about Denko, I get unpleasant responses.
>So please consider that I’m very hurt right now

And Denko’s been hurt far, far worse.

#2ch
Give it to us clearly, okay?
Are you gonna ditch or are you gonna post?

#OP
Sorry, I’ll write some…
It really does put me at ease when I make posts here… (´･ω･`)
I want to live in peace. I haven’t been sleeping well lately.

Why do I have to put up with a life of bullying?
I don’t know, but I know I have to face it somehow…
And I want the people bullying me to know they’re being silly.

#2ch
While it’s true you might be criticized when you talk about Denko, some people won’t give advice if you avoid talking about her. Just understand that.

#2ch
If you don’t like the environment at school, look for something new.
Absorb yourself in a hobby, or go somewhere where rumors about OP won’t reach you, and do what you want to do.

#OP
Thanks for the serious reply! (´･ω･`)
Not giving a reaction is really hard…
I might have done so without even realizing it.
Hobbies… Uh, I like H games and comics, but no real hobbies…
Do you think things would settle themselves if I didn’t go to school for two months?

#2ch
Do you have any idea how much trouble you’ve caused Tendou?
You need to apologize to Tendou for everything, now.

#OP
Uh? (´･ω･`) You know Denko’s nickname?
Are you from school?

#OP
You know the nickname Tendou?
If you’re acquaintances, I want her to reply… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
This isn’t any time for you to be interrogating me, you creep.
A loner like you never considering the other’s feelings and pushing himself on her is the worst of the worst.

If you don’t get that, then you’re beyond all help.

#2ch
^ Could you tell us more details about the flower-viewing if possible?

#OP
IF YOU’RE SAYING THINGS ABOUT DENKO AND ME THEN I’LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU
I’LL FIND YOU I SWEAR

#2ch
Eep…

#2ch
Oh bajeezus.
I know he’ll do it, too.

#2ch
uh


uh

#2ch
i peed a little

#2ch
There was no (´･ω･`)…

GUYS HE’S SERIOUS!!!

#OP
Do you really know Denko?
If you really know her, tell me what she was wearing to the flower-viewing! (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Say, if Denko filed a stalker report, is it likely this guy would get arrested?

#2ch
Very likely, surely?
If this guy gets ignored, then law enforcement is a joke when it comes to stalking.

#2ch
This would all be seriously traumatic to almost any girl, especially a fragile one.
OP still doesn’t seem to understand the ramifications of his actions.
Maybe we should get a hold of people nearby to file a claim for Denko.

#2ch
So in short, OP stalked Denko and is getting bullied for it, but is acting like he’s the victim?

#2ch
^ Yes sir.

#OP
I don’t want to hurt anyone, but I do know karate.
I really don’t like violence…
But this might be my chance to overcome my traumas… (´･ω･`)
It’s this or put up with it for two months…

#2ch
Where are you getting two months from?

#OP
I was advised here that if I endured it for two months, it would go away. (´･ω･`)

#2ch
What’re your plans for today, OP?

#OP
Wondering if I should go to school or not… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Why can’t you tell us a straight cause for the bullying?
Are you just going to keep saying “rumors”??

#2ch
So, she didn’t like the thing at the flower-viewing, did she?

#OP
Apparently not… I can’t take any more wounds.
Just seeing “Denko” makes me feel like my chest is being carved out of me…

#2ch
Hey, stop making fun of OP, okay!!
Can you say everything you want to talk about, OP?
About the cause for bullying, the rumors you haven’t specified about, about Denko…
We’ll talk it all out with you. Okay?

#OP
Sniff… Thank you…
I’m glad there’s a few good people… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
You goddamn… Were you threatening Denko with violence?

Not saying anything to guys and threatening women? You’re the worst.
What a waste of space. It’s obvious why you’re being bullied.

#OP
WHAT I WASN’T THREATENING HER (´･ω･`)
I just grabbed her, okay?
If you’re that guy from school, please don’t talk about this anymore…

#2ch
You got in an argument with Denko, grabbed her arm, and groped her. You’re a piece of shit is what you are.

#2ch
^ Hooray, Denko’s friend!

#OP
Whoa, wait, I let go right away… I didn’t grope her! (´･ω･`)
Everyone, please, don’t let this guy lead you astray.

#2ch
Do you honestly think you’re convincing anyone at this point?

#2ch
You damn liar! Don’t use your stupid-ass emoticon with me! You gonna do something about that attitude problem?!?

#2ch
Hear it from me, guys. This guy says he’s being bullied in college, but in reality he’s a sack of shit who Denko loathes for chasing her around, and he sees the situation as him being goddamn bullied. He’s the epitome of creepy stalkers.

#OP
If I talk more about the flower-viewing, it’ll agitate the situation!
All your name-calling is really hurting me…
I want you to promise you won’t make fun of me.
It’s a really delicate situation, so I don’t want things to get worse, or I’ll go nuts… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Too late.

#2ch
Don’t be ridiculous.
You don’t want to “agitate” things by talking about the flower-viewing? There’s nothing more that needs to be said! You’re just going to be a little shit who won’t apologize to Denko. Don’t ever come near her again!

#2ch
^ Whoa, calm down. Can you tell us if something happened?
There’s no sense in getting angry.

#OP
Whoa, everyone’s so nice…
I’ve never had so many people be this nice to me before… (´･ω･`)

#OP
Ohh, I’m scared…
But I’ll write it now… I’m so glad there are so many people supporting me… (´･ω･`)
Um, after the stuff happened, I got called by “A-ko,” who was headed to Yoyogi Park as planned.
But the place was pretty large, so I couldn’t find the place she told me to go to.
All she wrote that it was a hilly place in Yoyogi Park…

#OP
But eventually I found the hilly place, and of course Denko was there.
I watched with a telescope and waited for a chance when she wouldn’t see me.
I thought A-ko was going to have Denko go to the store, but she suddenly said she wouldn’t do it unless I paid an additional 30,000 yen.
So of course I promised I’d pay 30,000 more, and she sent Denko to the store alone.
There was a road for bikes near where Denko was, but Denko looked toward me for some reason, and I unconsciously got down on the ground… (´･ω･`)

#OP
Sorry for going off-topic. (´･ω･`)
So then Denko found me on the cycling road.
She looked back my way once or twice.
Then she ran with incredible speed toward me while I was squatting!
And I thought “Huh? Maybe I’ve cleared up the misunderstandings?”, stood up immediately, and waved at Denko as she ran toward me.


[Then the thread hit 1000 posts. But I won’t dare make this a cliffhanger.]


[Help!] I’m Suffering From These Rumors (´･ω･`)

#OP
Making a new thread here for now. (´･ω･`)

#OP
Okay, time to continue… (´･ω･`)
So I was waving at Denko waiting for her to come this way.
But then Denko threw her bag at me really hard, and I ducked to dodge it.
But in the next moment, Denko screamed and kicked me right in the chin.
It was so unlike her, it absolutely stunned me…
I never would have dreamed I’d get kicked by Denko.
So I quickly grabbed Denko’s hand to stop her rampaging.
Right? Since it was just a misunderstanding? (´･ω･`)

#2ch
SHINING WIZARD!!

#2ch
DENKO GJ

#2ch
Denko’s had a whole lot of stress built up…
I’m not surprised she’d get violent, no matter what you said to her.

#2ch
Then what? What about A-ko?
And everyone else involved?

#2ch
Holy shit Denko! We’re proud of you, girl!
I’d been imagining her as a weakling since all we know is she’s being stalked, but damn was I wrong…

#2ch
Is it possible the friend who showed up in the thread was A-ko?
They had details on the flower-viewing incident, too.

#2ch
If it was A-ko, it seems weird she’d say “What did you do to Denko?”, doesn’t it?
Since A-ko is selling info to the OP.
The part about “threatening with violence,” too, since Denko used the Shining Wizard on OP.

Maybe A-ko is the final boss? If this is like an RPG?

#OP
SORRY I GOT A CALL FROM A-KO.
She said she had good info, but when I said I would be hard up for cash this month, she hung up on me… (´･ω･`)
I’m talking with my mom now.

#OP
Okay, sorry for going off-topic.
I’ve been sorting things out, so I was late with this… (´･ω･`)

So Denko was getting violent and I grabbed her hand, but she screamed really loud.
I immediately thought, oh no, she misunderstood me again, so I got on the ground and started apologizing.
I think it got through to Denko, because then she broke down crying.
But then A-ko (the one who gave me info on Denko) came with some other girl I don’t know, and they suddenly pushed us apart… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
I’m serious, stop posting your made-up crap on 2chan!

People, don’t believe a word this guy says about what happened today!

#2ch
^ Well, I believe him more than you, since there’s actually something TO believe.

#2ch
^ Is this A-ko?

#2ch
^ Compared to you going “NO YOU’RE WRONG,” I’m going with the OP, who’s at least starting to talk.
Because anybody can just say “nope, that’s not true.”

#2ch
I’ve heard all of OP’s story, so I want to hear this person’s too, but there’s one thing I want to ask.

What do you think about A-ko selling info to OP despite knowing Denko despises him?

#2ch
^ I don’t believe it. It’s just a fabrication by the OP!
And Denko would never get violent!
This guy is seriously messed in the head!

#2ch
^ Stop trying to be emotional about this, okay?
Why else would OP know the time, place, and so on of the flower-viewing?
And the changed email addresses and phone numbers? It’s probably even why he got busted.
I know lots of women tend to dodge questions like this, but doing this is just being pointlessly cruel to Delico, okay?

#2ch
DELICO.

#2ch
^ OH GOD I DIED AT “DELICO”

#OP
So they shouted at me, calling me a pervert…
And even A-ko told me “Don’t get any closer to Denko!”
It’s not something I expected at all… It made me cry from shock…
And when Denko asked what I want from her, I was sobbing and saying I just want us two to talk! (´･ω･`)
Then it was silent for a while, and Denko said that as long as A-ko and ___ were watching, she would listen.
And then I realized…
Right! I had to confess under the cherry blossoms!

#2ch
This guy is really something if he thinks “I should confess!” after all that.

#OP
So then I led Denko under a cherry blossom within sight of A-ko and the mystery girl.
Then I casually pushed Denko from behind under the tree.
I wanted to talk about my feelings, and how Denko was misunderstanding me.
Of course, I was thinking of all these things to say to lead up to confessing to Denko.
And I was sweating so much it was getting in my eyes, so Denko gave me a handkerchief.
But the next moment, Denko suddenly said, before I could confess…
"There’s someone I like, and I’m sorry, ___, but it isn’t you."
It was so out of left field, like I had been suddenly hit with a baseball bat… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Whoa, man, that’s rough. What happened next?

#OP
Thank you… (´･ω･`) It was such a rough day, I didn’t even eat…

Denko told me “If you’re really thinking about me, please, consider how I feel.”
So I was glad to hear that Denko knew I thought about her more than anything else.
But I really despised this guy that Denko liked… (I’ll have to get info on him from A-ko…)
I never considered for a second Denko would care for anyone but me, so it was a huge shock.
So Denko shook my hand, made me promise not to come near her again, and we went home.

#2ch
Keep that goddamn promise…

#2ch
SHIT DUDE RUN

#2ch
Have you yet to tell Denko about how you’re so devoted, you’re paying A-ko to hear more about her??

I mean, if I were a girl, I’d be moved to tears by that.

#OP
A-ko’s still giving me info about Denko.
If I cut things off with A-ko, I’d be really stuck… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
I thought you said you didn’t fully trust A-ko?
Why’s OP being so careful with A-ko?

#OP
BECAUSE SHE SAYS DENKO DOESN’T LIKE ME. (´･ω･`)

#2ch
But that’s true… ROFL

#2ch
I really don’t know how you could raise a kid this effed in the head.

#2ch
Looks like this is over.
Break up, guys.

#2ch
OP sure is being slow…

I’m getting kind of worried.

#2ch
All the other threads ended this way too.
Give it some time and he’ll make another thread.
'Cause he's a troll.

#2ch
These threads never have a satisfying ending…

#Fifth Thread (final)
The fifth and final part of the saga from 2ch. Make sure to start from the first thread. (Posts from the thread-starter are labeled #OP, the people replying to him are labeled #2ch.)

#2ch
Substituting for the OP.
Not really sure what the title means…

#2ch
ARREST HIM ALREADY.

#2ch
This again…

#2ch
Oh boy, 600-email-man again…
So I know up to Denko using the Shining Wizard on OP.
What happened next?

#2ch
I think he’s getting bullied at school?

#OP
Thank you, thread-starter! You’re a real help! (´･ω･`)
I’m very grateful.

#OP
Um, I was suddenly dropped to level 0, so I couldn’t start it myself. Sorry.
Also, there’s a scary middle-schooler in front of the dojo, so I stopped practicing my Kyokushin karate… (´･ω･`)
Now, about Denko’s “boyfriend”…

#2ch
How’s that evil mastermind A-ko doing?

#OP
Actually, I’d rather you not say bad things about A-ko right now… (´･ω･`)

So it turns out Denko doesn’t actually have a boyfriend…
I’m seriously shocked Denko would lie to me.
Why would she do that?
She shook my hand when we parted, so I don’t think she really hates me…

#2ch
Sheesh, you can’t extrapolate that just from a handshake…
And you were saying you didn’t trust A-ko before, and now suddenly you’re her babysitter?

#OP
Sorry, I’ll give more details.
So I asked A-ko for some advice?
And she was harsh. She said I had a 10% chance of getting with Denko at best.
Then I suddenly realized, maybe A-ko’s jealous of me… (´･ω･`)
And then it was so clear to me why A-ko was selling me information!
Maybe she just wanted to talk to me all along?

Once I had that thought, I started to see A-ko’s kindness, and I realized my feelings were starting to shift toward A-ko a little… (´･ω･`)
Does anyone have experience loving two people at the same time?
I don’t know how to describe these feelings…

#2ch
What?










What?

#2ch
The most outrageous misunderstanding of all time…
So self-absorbed…

Well, no point in telling us about it. Go confirm that A-ko likes you, OP.

#OP
I’m not that self-absorbed… (´･ω･`)
I’m really worried… Maybe it’s since Denko carved out my heart that I’m being fooled into thinking I love A-ko?

Of course, it’s also possible I could love two people…
As long as they respond to my emails, I mean.
But how should I ask her? (´･ω･`)

#2ch
"Do you like anal?"

#OP
Y-Yikes…
What would happen if I asked a girl that?
I don’t think I want to ask that at all… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
You won’t know until you try!
Gotta live and learn!

#OP
Well, I sent “Do you like anal?”… (´･ω･`)
I’ve had some bad experiences thanks to some of you guys’ replies, though…
If this makes her not like me, I’m gonna be really stuck…

#2ch
GJ

#2ch
A-ko, you gave me advice, right?
You were harsh with me, saying I have a 10% chance with Denko at best.

But I had this sudden thought.
A-ko, could you possibly be jealous of Denko?
If that’s the case, then I think I know why you wanted to contact me now.
You just wanted to talk with me, didn’t you? Yes, it’s all coming together now.

After realizing this, I’ve come to notice your kindness, A-ko, and I’ve noticed my feelings are shifting toward you.

I love you too, A-ko.
So could I ask your feelings…?


^ Send this.

#OP
Wow, she replied already! (´･ω･`)

Subject: G☆R☆O☆S☆S

Since she put stars in it, is that good? Did I get through to her? (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Sounds perfect.

#2ch
You got her for sure!
You can do this! Go for it!

#OP
Okay, I think I might have this! (´･ω･`)
I sent A-ko “Know what I mean? (´･ω･`)”

#OP
Here we go… (´･ω･`)

Contents:
*angry-wrinkles symbol*

Hrmm… maybe she was confused what I meant with my message… (´･ω･`)
But I think we’re doing well so far. Want to drop the big question soon…

#2ch
This is the perfect time to send that earlier suggestion!

#2ch
Maybe they aren’t wrinkles, but an intersection.
So she wants to meet you?

#2ch
^ !!

#OP
I see, so I AM being tested… (´･ω･`)
Okay, since a lot of people wanted it, I sent that suggested reply.

#2ch
Perhaps it would be better that A-ko, the girl who sells info about her friends, is targeted rather than the innocent Denko…

#OP
Now that I sent it, I’m really worrying what I’ll do if Denko confesses to me too… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Neither will.

#2ch
It’s fine.

SINCE THAT WON’T HAPPEN.

#2ch
Date them both!

#2ch
I wouldn’t worry about it.

#2ch
What celebrities would you compare A-ko to?

#OP
Uh, I don’t know many celebrities, so that’s hard to say… (´･ω･`)
She would probably fit in a hostess club, though.

#2ch
Look at you guys, mocking OP when he’s so close to losing his virginity.

#OP
W-Whoa…
Am I close? Really?
This is making me excited… (´･ω･`)

Can’t wait for A-ko to email me, oh man…

#2ch
MAKE SURE TO POST LIVE WHILE YOU’RE LOSING YOUR VIRGINITY!

#2ch
[Help!] I’m Not Sure Where My Girlfriend’s Hole Is

#2ch
If you’re going to have sex with A-ko, she’s gonna need payment. Somewhere in the order of 500,000 yen.

#2ch
We’ve entered a whole new world of Mr. Stalker’s misunderstandings…

#2ch
Haha, A-ko would “fit in a hostess club”…
Is she that slutty?
Lots of women like that will only date men for their money, y’know.

#2ch
I want this to be made into a whole bunch of media, like Densha Otoko.

#2ch
OP’s illness is getting worse.
He must be off his meds.
It’s dangerous to keep this up.
Please, take your medication and tell your doctor about this.

#OP
SHE REPLIED!!

Contents:
So you’re saying you want to date?

Huh? D-Do I want to date A-ko…? (´･ω･`)
I’m worried about Denko too…
If I date her, then I won’t be able to date Denko, will I?

#2ch
Whatever your choice, the result will be the same.

#2ch
She’s throwing all sorts of signs, moron! Don’t back away from this!

#2ch
Seems obvious to me. Three can play at this game.

#2ch
If things end with A-ko, propose to Denko again.
But for now, go with A-ko.

#2ch
Even if you’re rejected, you’ve still got Denko, OP! Tell her you wanna date!
And girls love men with experience, trust me.

#2ch
Hostess-club girls generally won’t leave hopeless guys alone.
And since OP’s getting bullied even at college, he passes with flying colors…!

#OP
Sniff… um…
I just sent this… (´･ω･`)
"Do you want to date me, A-ko?"

#2ch
Are you retarded?

#2ch
Only virgins answer a question with a question.

#2ch
What? Are you kidding me?
A-ko asks if you wanted to date, you replied asking if she wants to date you? Girls hate men like that!
God, you should’ve just straight-up said you wanted to date…

#2ch
You never let us down, OP.

#2ch
It’s times like these I’m made even more aware than usual that OP is a virgin.

#OP
If A-ko says she wants to date, then I wonder if I’ll have to forget about Denko…
I’m getting a little marriage-blue… (´･ω･`)
[The term is supposed to refer to “blues” associated with an approaching marriage, such as anxiety about what life will be like afterward.]

#2ch
Uhhhm. I don’t think you know what “marriage-blue” means…

#2ch
You’re already getting married?!

#2ch
Do you just not have any idea what marriage-blue means?
Or are you already planning to marry A-ko?
I literally can’t tell…!

#2ch
(´･ω･`)
^ This is not the face of marriage-blue.

#2ch
Follow up with this?
"I’m sorry. I was so shocked, I replied with a question instead.
That’s just how it goes when I’m anxious about you, A-ko. So yes, please, go out with me.”
I mean why didn’t you just say that to begin with???

#OP
Sorry, but what exactly was the problem with what I sent?
I’m getting impatient over the lack of reply, though… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Because you replied with a question!
When you could’ve just been a man and said “Yes, I want to date you!”

#2ch
There’s no problem! It’s perfect!

#OP
Thanks a lot, guys, now I’m worried I’m making big mistakes… (´･ω･`)
I’m getting a little depressed here…

Huh? What? What, what?
Is this real life or just fantasy?????

#2ch
The twist no one’s expected since the first thread…

#OP
Going to A-ko’s side right after breaking up with Denko would be really… I dunno… (´･ω･`)
I don’t have any idea how to respond.
Should we date? Won’t she think I’m fickle then?

#2ch
"Broke up"… YOU WEREn’T EVER DATING…

#OP
Sent this. (´･ω･`)
"If you really want to, then could we date so we can get married later?"

Right! I’ll forget about Denko if I have to…! Sniff…

#2ch
Congrats, dude!

#2ch
GJ!!!
You’ve done well.

#2ch
So NOW it’s marriage-blue, huh…

#2ch
So you can get… get married later… omfg…

#OP
Got a reply! That was quick!

Contents:
I look forward to it too! *smile*
I just want you to promise me three things:
First, don’t tell anyone we’re dating.
Second, I’m the one in charge here, and if you deny it, then this is all void.
Third, as a general rule, you’re forbidden from contacting me if I don’t contact you first.
Can you uphold those three for me? ♥

So yeah… (´･ω･`) Kinda strange how she doesn’t want me to contact her, huh?

#2ch
OMG, it’s like she wants you to sign a contract…

#2ch
Oh yeah, she’s totally after your brother and money…

#2ch
She wants to have a monopoly on you!
Isn’t that cute?

#2ch
Raise your hand, did anyone see this coming back when it was just 600 emails?

#2ch
Sounds like she’s stopping just short of saying “I’ll contact you whenever I need money, thanks! o(^▽^)o”

#2ch
[Hooray!] I Got A Personal ATM (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Dang… What color is A-ko’s blood?

#2ch
Sometimes, you find happiness in places where you least expect it.

Congratulations…!
I really mean it…!

#OP
Sent this… (´･ω･`)

"Don’t you think it’s a little harsh saying I can’t contact you myself? (´･ω･`)"

#2ch
Be more forceful!
See, this is why you’re a virgin.

#OP
Thanks! You’re absolutely right! I’m feeling braver now!
Sent this: “Never mind, I was just kidding! Let’s date!! I love you!!” (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Brave enough to become a slave, apparently…

#2ch
You need to have three conditions of your own.
1: Don’t have sex with anyone but me.
2: Have sex with me once a day.
3: Don’t spend my money on anything.

#2ch
Hahaha, talk about an unfair deal!
FF13 gives you more freedom than that!

#OP
Reply reply reply!

Contents:
As a general rule, you’re forbidden from contacting me if I don’t contact you first.
Gosh, do I need to say it twice? I’ll let you off with a warning this time, so be more careful from now on. *smile*
So I guess that makes today, April 21st, our anniversary! ♥
Make sure you never, ever forget it!

Whoaaa… It’s a virginity countdown now… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Now’s your chance!
You gotta say something to show you’ll remember it, or else!

#2ch
A-ko is pro.

#2ch
Time to Lost Virginity: XX years

#2ch
^ two digits, rofl

#OP
Umm, she said not to tell anyone we were dating, but maybe I should let Denko know? (´･ω･`)
Also, what should I give her for our anniversary?

#2ch
The best present of all would be your smile.
Go meet her pronto!

#2ch
Give her your virginity, dummy!

#OP
For now, I told Denko I had something important to tell her… (´･ω･`)
And I asked A-ko “Can we meet after school today?”!
Three-dimensional ecchi tonight… Even I didn’t see this coming…

#2ch
Not if you don’t pay up 300,000 yen.

#2ch
Where ya gonna do it?

#OP
I don’t suppose the park would work? (´･ω･`)

#2ch
AT LEAST GO TO A HOTEL MAN.

#2ch
Wh… what are you… what?
Can’t you meet anywhere else?

#OP
I’ve never been to a hotel before, so I’m embarrassed… (´･ω･`)
Waiting for a reply now…
Maybe I should bring a vibrator?

#2ch
A virgin bringing a vibrator, omg…
Hell, make that your anniversary present.

#OP
And of course, wouldn’t it be romantic to go with A-ko to Yoyogi Park, that memorable place, and see the cherry blossoms together? (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Memorable for getting Shining Wizarded, you mean…?

#2ch
Yeah, romantic would be good.
The buzz of a vibrator backed by cherry blossoms… superb.

#2ch
Oh, you’re such a romantic. I tip my hat to you, sir.
You’re like the Japanese Shakespeare, you are.
Girls fall head over heels for romantic types, so good luck!

#OP
In H manga, girls usually pretend to dislike vibrators, but inside they really enjoy it.
But all my knowledge is manga and games, so I don’t know if it’s really true… (´･ω･`)
Help…

#2ch
Have you never read a NORMAL romance manga?

#OP
No emails, so I might have to send one myself… (´･ω･`)
It hurts… (´･ω･`)
I don’t have a vibrator, so I’ll have to go buy one from Don Quijote. Buh-bye!

#2ch
Don’t worry, H games are basically just reality in game form.

#OP
While I was headed to Don Quijote, I got a shocking email…

Contents:
Sure! *smile* We can meet anywhere! Go ahead, you decide!
Oh, but one more thing I need to say.
I want you to stay pure until we get married.
I’m looking forward to my wedding night with you, since we’re leading up to marriage here. *smile*
So no touchy-touchy until then, please! ♥

Whoa… L-Looking forward to… She’s really eager!
And she’s a virgin too? A-ko’s such a good girl…
Oh man, I’m super excited!
Since I guess I won’t need the vibrator for now, I bought some lotion to use in the bath.
I hope we can use it together soon… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
I don’t think she’s getting in a bath with you…

#2ch
>I’m looking forward to my wedding night with you, since we’re leading up to marriage here. *smile*
>So no touchy-touchy until then, please! ♥

We’ll be waiting forever…

#2ch
If you’re keeping your promises, you should really make sure she’s a virgin too.

#2ch
^ Yeah, definitely do this.
Is there a single college girl in Tokyo that keeps her chastity these days?

#OP
Going in the bath will be fine.
We’ll probably have to touch, mmm… (´･ω･`)
I sent her “I’m going to Don Quijote to get some stuff for the bath, so we can go in together!”
Knowing A-ko’s such a good girl as to save herself for marriage is just raising the stakes…
But we’re definitely going into the bath together! So I guess a hotel, huh…
First time at a hotel… I’m nervous… (´･ω･`) My armpits are sweating…

#OP
Got an email!

Contents:
Huh? What do you mean?

What do you mean, “what do you mean”…? (´･ω･`)
And “Huh?” makes it sound like she’s a little embarrassed inside…
For now, I sent “How does ___ sound as a meeting point? I’ll tell you after school! (´･ω･`)”!!
Spring is coming, and I’m sorry I’ve troubled you all. But I’m really grateful! Thanks!!
I bet you can all get great girlfriends too!!

#2ch
You really don’t think about anything but what’s convenient for you, do you…
You’re sick, man, get help!

#2ch
For real, what ARE you talking about…
Suddenly bringing up going in the bath? Like, what?



[Help!] I’m Deathly Confused By How Women Think (´･ω･`)

#OP
We just started dating, but I’m really surprised by the differences in how men and women think.
I need to know the secrets of good dating… (´･ω･`)
Like where to have good dates…

#2ch
Why, you… Are you the Denko guy?

#OP
Ah, uh, yes, you were all very helpful with Denko. (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Oh, it’s A-ko now, right…
The master-slave relationship.

#2ch
Did you give up on Denko or what?

#OP
I wrote a letter and gave it to her! (´･ω･`)

#2ch
At any rate, you need to be close with your partner.

#OP
Hm… Is that the trick to a long relationship?

#2ch
What happened next, OP?

#2ch
How’s it going with A-ko?
Well?

#OP
A lot of stuff happened at the hotel, and we had sex… (´･ω･`)
Though we had a serious dispute after…

#2ch
First, tell us what’s not going well, and list what you don’t understand.

#OP
Men and women just seem to think so differently… (´･ω･`)
So there’s a lot of stuff I’m worried about.
Like if a guy has unprotected sex, does that mean he thinks of women as being solely for pleasure?
Which would make a girl really mad…
Because yeah, she got really mad at me… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
How much did you pay to sex A-ko?

#OP
She said she’d do it if I bought her 500,000 yen in clothes, but that’s a lot of money, so I negotiated it down to 350,000… (´･ω･`)
It was a really great experience, better than I could’ve imagined… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Christ, where the hell are you getting your money?

#OP
My family is pretty rich, and I know where they hide the money… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
How much have you paid A-ko in total?

#OP
I don’t know… Probably more than 700,000 yen?

#2ch
What, ONLY 700,000 yen?
A regular couple going from first dates to intercourse takes at least 2 million!

Love A-ko more, dammit!

#2ch
Wait, you “know where they hide the money”? You’re stealing money from your parents?

I’m… curious, to say the least.

#2ch
Unprotected sex, jfc… How irresponsible are you?
If you get together, how the hell are you going to raise a kid?
I feel beyond bad for any kid with a parent like you…

#OP
A-ko said the same thing… I guess that’s how girls think… (´･ω･`)
Well, I’ve learned from it now.
But girls like it that way in H manga and porn videos, right?
I thought unprotected was supposed to be better…

#2ch
This is quite a direction things are going in…

#2ch
You need to learn that sexy books are different from real life!
Did you at least give a good apology?

#OP
I’m not really sure why I’d need to apologize, since I was crying with her too…
The third dimension is hard… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Just get a prostitute, man! 350,000 yen, hot damn…

#OP
There’s no love with prostitutes, so I don’t wanna… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
What’s OP’s idea of a “girlfriend”? What does it mean to you?

#OP
An embodiment of love? I dunno, you’re embarrassing me… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
You’re right, the third dimension is hard.
But intercourse is a holy act that gives way to new life, too.
You’ve learned you can’t be careless, right, OP?
If you make a single misstep, A-ko will just think you’re incredibly irresponsible.
So be more careful with her, okay?

#OP
Huh? But if she has a baby, will we be able to raise it together?
I’m not irresponsible enough to abandon a baby… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Men who can’t cook ain’t suited for marriage, dude!

#OP
I CAN MAKE SPAGHETTI (´･ω･`)

#2ch
A-ko is your girlfriend. You should want to see your kid in the future.
It was just a bad time for it.
When you both want it, then have all the unprotected sex you want.

#2ch
I know how you feel. When you fall in love, everything seems to run right by you.
But does A-ko want children right now?
If she doesn’t, then of course she’ll get mad.
But if you both really want kids, then it’s not too late.
And more importantly, consider the kid’s happiness too.

#OP
That’s a novel thought! I just sent that to A-ko!

#2ch
You had sex with A-ko? And she was a virgin?

#OP
She said it was her first time… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Reading through all this, I’ve been interested in OP himself.
What kind of environment did your family raise you in?
If we know that, we might know OP’s personality better to give him better advice.

#OP
I think it’s a pretty ordinary family…
I guess my mom was extra nice to me… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
What did you write in that letter to Denko?
Wasn’t dating A-ko supposed to be a secret?

And if A-ko said she wanted to be a virgin until marriage, was she really planning to marry OP?

#2ch
Once Denko learns this situation with A-ko, she’s gonna be jealous for sure.
Since he put out 700,000 yen for her.
Then her love for him will truly come out.

#OP
I talked with Denko in private about dating A-ko.
I’m still a little in love with Denko, like I thought I might be…
I might be happy in a way if she got jealous… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
If you spent 350,000 of the 700,000 for sexytimes, what was the rest for?

#OP
Buying information, mostly… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Make sure to keep enough around for pregnancy, birth, and child-raising.

#OP
Well, I’ll do my best. (´･ω･`)

#2ch
So OP has rich parents, huh.
And his mother was nice, but what about his father?
Also, his brother said he didn’t want to get involved with him. How’d it come to that? Did something happen?

#OP
We had a fight a long time ago, and I guess he’s still mad about it… (´･ω･`)
My dad was usually at work, so I don’t have much of an image of him. (´･ω･`)

#2ch
What was the fight about?

#OP
I don’t really want to say… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
OP sure is something.
If possible, can you tell us how things went to get to the sex?
I want it for reference.

#OP
I guess the trick is appealing to how much you think about the girl…? (´･ω･`)

#2ch
Huh?? You said you sent her an email, but didn’t she forbid OP sending her emails??

#OP
Well, she hasn’t replied in four days, so I was getting really worried… (´･ω･`)

#2ch
What happened to the bullying at school?

#OP
I’m not going to school! I’m probably not going back for another month…

#2ch
You should go to school!
I’m sure A-ko wants to see you at school, too!

She’s been too timid to email you for four days.

You have to consider that A-ko wants to be with you more, OP!

#OP
So sleepy… (´･ω･`)

I don’t have the courage to go to school…

#2ch
What’s up with A-ko now?

#OP
I don’t know… I don’t get how girls think at all…

#2ch
A-ko’s a good girl.
Giving her virginity to OP…

#2ch
Except I really doubt she’s a virgin…

#2ch
Maybe he fell asleep?

Looking forward to the next conversation.

#2ch
I guess… I’ll sleep too.

#2ch
Looking forward to the next thread.



And then…

…and then, nothing.

The OP didn’t post again. The thread died. And unless people just stopped keeping a lookout for threads titled “[Help!] ___ (´･ω･`)”, nothing more was posted. We never know what happened to the perhaps-no-longer-stalked Denko, the apparently-pregnant A-ko, or… the OP.

The first thread was started on April 6th, 2011, and the last post from the OP was on May 2nd, 2011. However, the threads only came to my attention recently, perhaps because it had been nearly a year since people last heard about them.

I think the comment near the end of the second thread says it pretty well. Even if the OP was a troll, it’s scary that he could even make these things up. It’s scary because - as some of us know firsthand - people like him do exist, even if they aren’t all obvious about it online.

Whether or not the OP was real only determines whether or not Denko was a real girl suffering from real stalking. There still can be and still have been countless others whom this really, definitely happens to.

At any rate, this is the way the story ends. Not with a shank, but with a
