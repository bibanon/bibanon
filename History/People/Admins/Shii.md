Shii is an important individual in the field of English-language anonymous forums, like [[world2ch]] and [[4chan]]. He is also a major contributor to [[Wikipedia]], especially on those articles pretaining to [[Otaku]] culture and [[2channel]].

Shii has his own personal wiki where he collects the random stuff he writes, and some important stories he archived from [[Wikichan]]. This wiki directly inspired the work of the Bibliotheca Anonoma.

## Shii's Wiki

Shii's wiki, called "Everything Shii Knows", is one of the first major personal wikis in existence. It was created in his disgust with the decisions Wikipedia had to make in a choice between editing anarchy and bureaucratic uselessness. He suggested that people should instead make their own personal wikis, which could then be synced together.

This wiki contains all his personal essays on recent and past events and subjects, along with a collection of bits from Wikichan that would have been forgotten otherwise.

Some of the stories archived, and also saved here, are:

* [[Nurse-kun|Damaged Goods]]
* [[Blindmute Loli]]
* [[American Dream]]
* [[From AOL Hacker to Businessman]]
* [[The Great Scam]]

It's a small, but very interesting collection.
