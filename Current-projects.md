### Partners

Other archival institutes or link pages.

* [Cyberlife](http://jinteki.tk/index.html) - Awesome cyberpunk archive that links back to this wiki. What treasures are found there?
* [United Chans Wikia](http://unitedchans.wikia.com) - Tons of great history articles on 4chan.

## Liquidation

These are stories or webpages that need to be converted and added to the Bibliotheca Anonoma.

* [[Chanarchive]] - RIP Edgeworth E. Euler. He went MIA and thus, all data from Chanarchive died with him. I deeply regret failing to convince him to send the backup somewhere safe... After all he did to try and save it, it is lost forever...
  * At least a significant fraction has been saved by archive.org, so we can attempt to reconstruct it and at least catalogue what was lost.
* [iiichan Wiki](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://wiki.iiichan.net/*) - Humblefool (David Ashby)'s personal wiki, made in the style of [[Shii]]'s wiki. Also deleted, but at least archives do exist.
* [[Shii]]'s Wiki (Done!) - Tons of interesting content was lost in Shii's wholesale deletion of a personal wiki that pretty much inspired the work of the Bibliotheca Anonoma.
  * Thanks to Sikmo, [the wiki has been restored in it's entirety, and is archived at the Bibliotheca Anonoma.](http://bibanon.github.io/everything-shii-knows/)
* [The Oppressors and the Oppressed](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7WYx7u6HJh_NXBrSEoyTHcxcW8/edit?usp=sharing) - Downloaded before chanarchive went down. This is an AMA from a British military contractor who fought for Gaddafi during the Arab Spring in Libya; a brutal look at how the winners of war write the history.

* [[Oral Hygiene]] (Archived) - [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com/Gt47E4Nr), [Newer Pastebin](http://pastebin.com/90nWJGPt) - A Wikichan-era tale about some guy who brushes his sister's teeth. Reminiscent of that episode of Monogatari...

## Partnership

* [ArchiveTeam - 4chan](http://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=4chan) - The Archive Team wiki (part of the Internet Archive) has a list of important targets to archive. Chanarchive is a big one that was lost. Twice.
* [Stanford Digital Repository](http://purl.stanford.edu/tf565pz4260) - Henry Lowood (@Liebenwalde), Curator of History of Science & Technology, supports the archival of internet culture, happens to be constructing a 4chan section for the digital repository, and can provide archival space for much of our static data on Stanford servers.
