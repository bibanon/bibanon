Unfortunately, we haven't been very adept at keeping up the timeline. But starting from December 2014, we'll try to keep up.

## December 2014

### Events

*Major events or incidents involving 4chan anons.*

* 2014 4chan Autumn Babby Cup
* 2014 4chan Winter Cup

### Structural Changes

*Changes (permanent or temporary) to the structure of 4chan's website.*

* **2014-12-04** /a/ - Usaka Day. A terrible sketch of Asuka from Evangelion is made /a/'s header image, along with a ear grating bicycle horn rendition of Cruel Angel's Thesis. All other boards get a BKUB Chen header image and the bike horn.

* **2014-12-07** /pol/ and /s4s/ - Moot starts the day by testing out **CAPTCHA-less posting on /pol/.** As a result, eager anons begin to flood the board, and /pol/ users evacuate to colonize /s4s/. By the end of the day, moot renames /pol/ to [The 8 steps of Cuckolding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPM6LKIaopk), and autoplays this linked youtube video in the background.

  * **2014-12-08** - (ongoing as of 12/09) /pol/ - /pol/ is still being flooded. It looks like the mods may be dead set on killing it. Though Moot has often had a change of heart, such as with /r9k/.
  * As of 2014-12-11, the 8 Steps of Cuckolding are gone, but the board still remains a smoldering wreck. One ironic result of all this is that [Gamergate threads are now technically allowed](http://i.imgur.com/pZpPBIx.png).
  * 2014-12-12: [/pol/ becomes a robot.](http://i.imgur.com/TTA3PT5.png) Some techno song that just repeats the phrase "I am a robot" is playing in the background.
  * Note: Anons are fairly happy about a much-hated containment board being destroyed. But bear in mind that without a trash can, garbage will simply pile up everywhere. Please respect your trash cans.

### Epic Threads

* **2014-12-24** - /a/ - [[A Tsundere Christmas Carol]] is reposted to 4chan's /a/, as per tradition since 2011. However, the mods are feeling some serious Christmas Spirit and make it a board sticky.

## January 2015

* **2015-01-18** - moot requires all mods and janitors to sign a contract. The contract includes an NDA for 4chan "Proprietary Information".
