this is my story /b/...

> \>be me, 19 yo college freshman  
> \>this was 10 years ago  
> \>i had this bro from highschool, pete  
> \>we were friends, but not exactly bros. he was a cool guy, and i think i was cool to him  
> \>turns out we applied to the same college and enrolled  
> \>going to the same classes  
> \>practically spending all of our time together  
> \>away from you family, with your high school life behind you, things can get hectic  
> \>yeah, you are horny teenagers with no real problems to deal with  
> \>but you still need a friend you can depend on  
> \>and we were that friend to each other   

fast forward a couple of months

> \>second semester, we start taking this new class  
> \>and there is this girl in the class  
> \>not just us, but every fucking human being with a working dick in the entire campus is losing their shit over her  
> \>ordinary straight girls are ready to become lesbians just for her  
> \>i mean... man... wow... what an.. angel? a beam of light? deux ex machina descending from heaven? i have no fucking idea  
> \>a value over 10 is a measurement that applies to us, mere mortals  
> \>her beauty cannot be calculated or properly abstracted with numbers  
> \>and looking at her is like something you know you shouldnt do  
> \>not because its creepy or socially awkward or some other shit  
> \>its because you feel youre not worthy  
> \>not for her youre not. no. NOT HER.  
> \>but we were looking  
> \>turns out we first saw her practically at the same time  
> \>and we wanted to point her to one another   
> \>but we couldnt take our eyes off of her  
> \>so we sat in some lousy economy class or whatever and drooled over her for half an hour  
> \>before i whispered... "dude... fuck me..."  
> \>and it took pete a solid 5 minutes before he could simply say "yeah..."  
> \>there she was, this 5'9" lady with long wavy auburn hair and emerald green eyes to die for  
> \>and pretty sure, to kill for  
> \>sitting just a couple feet away from us  
> \>yeah... so.. "fuck me..." was the correct response in that situation  

pic is unrelated random chick.
> \>after the class  
> \>to this day i cant for the life of me remember what the fuck it was about  
> \>we were already orbiting her like some lousy asteroids stuck to a massive black hole  
> \>creepily getting closer and closer to her as she sucked us in  
> \>bumping to each other and walking like we were drunk and out of our minds  
> \>i dont know what it was  
> \>maybe she realized that we were following her like pervs  
> \>or maybe it was something else  
> \>halfway to the cafeteria, she just stopped and turned towards us  
> \>we comedically bumped into each other and stopped as well  
> \>but her beauty was so miraculous we forgot to look somewhere else  
> \>i remember her gaze.. it was like the back of our heads blew open and brains splattered all over the hallway  
> \>those green eyes man...  
> \>and she smiled. SHE FUCKING SMILED  
> \>if we werent healthy, fit males in their prime we would have died of heart attack at that moment  
> \>we couldnt breathe she was so beautiful  
> \>so there we were, still staring at her, our eyes and mouths wide open  
> \>we were in our low, waaay low 2 digit IQs at that moment  
> \>and there she was, in all of her glory  
> \>like i said, 5'9", long wavy auburn hair, emerald green eyes  
> \>long curvy and athletic legs, you know, slimmer at the knees  
> \>well defined muscles on her calves and soft but rigid thighs  
> \>her ankles were so elegant  
> \>but her tendons were sprained... as if she were a wild gazelle ready to bolt out at a moments notice  
> \>her butt... i cant call it an ass. not hers.  
> \>ass is what girls have.  
> \>this lady had something else. she had buttocks that required a new definition of the word  
> \>they were so firm and so well shaped, you could perfectly calculate for pi if you took measurements  
> \>her breasts... i dont even have the words  
> \>to this day im still searching for the right words  
> \>and i will try and describe them later in the story... but i will fail terribly  

> \>i can still remember what she was wearing that day  
> \>i know what she was wearing probably better than her on the day she wore them  
> \>and i know this because pete knew this  
> \>after she looked at us and smiled  
> \>just for a few seconds which felt like an eternity  
> \>she turned around again and kept on walking  
> \>we just stayed put  
> \>we couldnt follow her  
> \>our black hole left us lonely asteroids to the pitch black emptiness of cold space  
> \>so after the school, we went to our dorm room with no information about her whatsoever  
> \>no name, no nothing  
> \>just a mental image of her elegant stance etched deep into our minds  
> \>i was looking at the pictures of random women with green eyes and auburn hair on yahoo  
> \>that was the only thing i could do. but none of the images even came close to matching her beauty  
> \>well.. pete felt like he had to do something  
> \>and he fucking started searching for her clothes. i shit you not  
> \>he was searching for her clothes on amazon and ebay and all these fashion and shopping sites neither of us knew nothing about  
> \>he started with searching for her skirt  
> \>which was this black wool-cashmere circle skirt with a playful flare at the bottom  
> \>couple inches above her knees... revealing her thighs just a little bit..  
> \>when he found it, he shouted "I FOUND IT FUCK YEAH"  

> \>and i thought he had found "her"  
> \>but when i saw what he found, which was this i dunno what brand skirt on amazon  
> \>i was far from being disappointed  
> \>i was feeling the same way  
> \>we didnt know her name, but fuck if we didnt know what skirt she was wearing  
> \>pete kept going with the search and i helped him  
> \>at the end of the night, we knew what flats she was wearing, what shirt  
> \>we even knew what brand her red, bow shaped hairclip was  
> \>i mean... look, we are straight guys  
> \>i figure im a 7/10, maybe 8, pete is an easy 8/10, pushing 9  
> \>we are both fit, we dont have ugly pimples on our faces or anything, we are both very decent  
> \>we are not short or chubby  
> \>and altho we were not the most popular kids in highschool, we are definitely not social castouts either  
> \>but that night  
> \>we were more gay than a male fashion design student wearing pink dungarees and coming out of the closet singing YMCA  
> \>and we knew what skirt she was wearing... so yeah...  
> \>and before we went to sleep  
> \>pete had an idea  
> \>that motherfucker had the most excellent idea  
> \>he knew he needed an extra something if he was ever gonna talk to her  
> \>let alone date her  
> \>so he decided he should start learning about fashion  
> \>and use his knowledge as a conversation starter  
> \>meanwhile, i was feeling like i could go to mars with a new apollo mission  
> \>or save the world from a new nazi regime all by myself  
> \>and still wouldnt be able to impress her  
> \>i was a hopeless faggot  

> \>next morning, the first thing pete did was to enroll in a class on fashion design  
> \>pete didnt know if his tactics were gonna work  
> \>pete didnt know if this magnificent creature would speak fashion with him  
> \>but he had hopes  
> \>meanwhile, we were both unable to speak to her  
> \>we were a bunch of beta fags, scared out of our minds  
> \>but we learned her name from a friend  
> \>ella  
> \>ella was her name...  
> \>pete didnt want to waste his chances in leaving a perfect first impression with ella  
> \>well, the first impression both of us have left was us standing in the middle of the hallway  
> \>staring at her like we were retarded perverts  
> \>but speaking to her was a different matter altogether  
> \>i figured, if pete had no chance of talking to her now  
> \>how could i?  
> \>besides, pete was so in da zone, i didnt want to compete  
> \>not that i could, or so i believed...  
> \>fast forward a couple of weeks  
> \>pete as a freshman knew more about fashion than seniors knew about economy in our department  
> \>he was spending his nights browsing fashion blogs  
> \>every night, he would come to our room, with a list of items she was wearing that day  
> \>studying her taste in fashion  
> \>pete told me that this could actually work  
> \>since while a lot of the girls on campus dressed like trailer trashes  
> \>ella was always amazing in her choice of clothes  
> \>our room was filled with editions of vogue and GQ and shit  
> \>couple of friends have seen our stash of fashion magazines  
> \>and joked about it  
> \>so we made a lousy explanation of how they were "quality fapping material"  
> \>and got away with it  
> \>one day, pete woke up and turned to me  
> \>"i'm ready" - he said  
> \>like neo saying "i know kung-fu"  
> \>i said "show her"  
> \>anyways  
> \>pete decided that whatever she's wearing that day  
> \>he felt like he could intelligently talk to her about her clothes  

> \>after the economy class  
> \>i wished him luck and we parted ways  
> \>an hour later he found me  
> \>i asked him  
> \>"how did it go?"  
> \>"i dunno man... i really dunno. i mean, i might as well done great or fucked it up completely"  
> \>"why?"  
> \>"look, we talked about fashion for an hour"  
> \>"so, you talked for an hour, thats great man!" - damn we were beta fags  
> \>"yeah, but what if she thinks that im gay?"  
> \>i started laughing. pete had a point. straight guys dont usually talk about fashion  
> \>certainly not about womens fashion  
> \>suddenly, ella comes out of nowhere  
> \>i froze  
> \>pete looked at me and understood that ella was coming our way  
> \>"hey pete!"  
> \>and i heard ella's voice for the first time  
> \>she had a crackly, deep voice  
> \>kinda reminds me of scarlett johansson now...  
> \>a lot of people dont think that kinda voice is flattering  
> \>but if you found me a soprano that sings agnus dei  
> \>i would have told you "shut that woman up and let ella sing"  
> \>"hey ella!" - said pete, his heart probably skipping a couple of beats  
> \>"i remembered now... i got it from anthropologie..."  
> \>i have absolutely no idea what shes talking about  
> \>"oh thanks!"  
> \>"dont mention it... its from last season tho, i dont think you could buy it for your sister. but they might have something similar..."  
> \>"oh.. well, thank you for telling me ella!"  
> \>"youre welcome, see you around pete!"  
> \>"see you ella!"  
> \>and we watched ella walking away from us gracefuly, until she disappeared in the distance  
> \>still looking at her general direction, as if we could still see her  
> \>"dude... your sister is 7..."  
> \>"yeah i know..."  
> \>"..."  
> \>"..."  
> \>"she is..."  
> \>"yeah i know... magnificent..."  

> \>a week later, pete had another idea  
> \>in order to not look like a gay couple  
> \>he suggested that we develop this "manly handshake"  
> \>and establish that we are in fact, bros  
> \>like a bunch of idiots, we stayed up all night  
> \>working out this complex yet subtle (or so we thought) secret handshake  
> \>our stupidity was at an immeasurable new height  
> \>pete was chatting up ella, little by little everyday  
> \>but he was afraid of becoming a gay bff and lose all chance of dating her  
> \>so he requested me to approach them tomorrow at some point mid conversation  
> \>and "apply" the handshake  
> \>ok then  
> \>after our economy class  
> \>i gave pete some time  
> \>then joined them in the cafeteria  
> \>as i approached them, pete saw me coming  
> \>excused himself like a true boss gentleman  
> \>and we started acting out this ridiculous handshake in unison  
> \>i mean it was absolute bullshit  
> \>hands and fingers everywhere clicking and fist bumping and doing other various stuff  
> \>it was like the douchebag version of cirque de soleil  
> \>halfway thru (yeah it was that long it almost needed an interlude) ella starts laughing her ass off  
> \>she was laughing like a crazy person  
> \>we freeze  
> \>the blood drains away from pete's face  
> \>pale as fuck  
> \>we realize that we just fucked up  
> \>we fucked up immensely  
> \>and we force ourselves to turn and face ella  
> \>she's trying to silence herself, still laughing  
> \>pete and i still holding hands like fucktards  
> \>she tries to apologize for laughing  
> \>but then she starts laughing even louder  
> \>we look around and hope that no other person has acknowledged how dumb we look  
> \>fortunately no one other than ella is laughing  
> \>but ella is still laughing  

> \>pete has this "this is how i die" face  
> \>im all goodbyeworld.jpeg  
> \>ella's laughter finally dies down  
> \>and we're looking at her like rabbits caught in headlights  
> \>"guys... i know you're not gay" - and she starts laughing again  
> \>pete looks like hes about to shit his pants  
> \>and i dunno what it was, maybe i started losing my nerve  
> \>or maybe it was like a chain reaction to ella's laughter  
> \>i start laughing my ass off as well  
> \>that "manly handshake" started playing out in my head over and over again  
> \>and i began to imagine myself doing the handshake  
> \>and realized how absolutely idiotic it must have looked like  
> \>pete starts laughing as well  
> \>all three of us are crying at this point  
> \>now people are looking at us like wtf  
> \>and that was how i met ella  
> \>we finally sit down  
> \>im still chuckling like an ape  
> \>i extend my hand towards ella  
> \>"hi, im anon"  
> \>she firmly grabs my hand  
> \>my god her hands are beautiful  
> \>long, slender fingers embrace my hairy man paws like the branches of a delicate flower  
> \>she has a very cold touch  
> \>almost freezing, but at the same time its such an awakening feeling  
> \>i can feel the hairs on my forearm rising  
> \>"hi anon, im ella" - she responds with a warm smile  
> \>and an incredibly sharp, piercing gaze  
> \>her spellbinding green eyes are filled with both an "i got you now" attitude and an older sisters love  
> \>i melt  
> \>"for how long have you guys practiced that stupid handshake?" - she asks  
> \>we start blushing like 5 yo kids  

> \>"all night..." - pete answers as silently as possible  
> \>ella claps her hands and pops a loud chuckle  
> \>"i knew it!" - waving her finger towards us - "you guys are insecure!"  
> \>pete grumbles  
> \>"oooohh.. its so cute!" - she puts on a funny face, pouting her spectacular pink lips  
> \>im losing my grasp on english language right about now  
> \>"well guys, i know youre not gay... but youre definetely homophobic!"  
> \>"well... were not..." - i try to defend myself futilely  
> \>"oh its ok, anon!" - she smiles - "i can understand that feeling"  
> \>pete must be losing his mind.. he just sits there, trying to find a way to regain his composure  
> \>"oh come on pete, i know you would feel uneasy, talking to me about fashion"  
> \>pete looks shocked  
> \>he doesnt understand how he could be sidelined so bad  
> \>"but..." - he tries to make a case (which i assume he has none)  
> \>"its really ok pete. i can sense that you have been working on "fashion" (makes a fingerquote) for some time"  
> \>ohfuck.gif  
> \>our jaws are sweeping the floor  
> \>"how..." - pete mumbles  
> \>"seriously, i know about your fashion class, and your room full of fashion magazines"  
> \>ella winks at pete  
> \>im about to lose my shit  
> \>pete looks like hes shot by a cupids 50cal machine gun  
> \>hes crushing hard, madly in love  
> \>"how did you know?" - i ask, since pete cannot come to the phone right now  
> \>"well... first of all, i have a friend in pete's fashion class"  
> \>"and also, some of your chums were talking about your stash and i overheard them"  
> \>pete silently mouths "fuck me..."  
> \>"but most of all, pete, i can see that you are new to the fashion world"  
> \>"where did i go wrong?" - pete must have been losing his hope at this point  
> \>"well, a fashionista... how can i put it... must look more fashionable, dont you think?"  
> \>ella was right. granted, pete didnt walk around wearing shitty flip flops and baggy sweat pants  
> \>but he wasnt actually a fashion icon either  
> \>pete looks like hes about to burst into tears  

> \>"besides, your fashion sense has no context. a person who is deeply involved in any subject always speaks in some form of context"  
> \>as ella talks about pete's failure, i feel both incredibly sad and incredibly turned on  
> \>maybe im not from a family or a place where there were a lot of smart women around   
> \>and maybe i was just a dumb homophobic or maybe even sexist fuck  
> \>who thinks all women learn about everything in life by furiously banging ken and barbie dolls into each other in their childhood  
> \>but ill be damned if this magnificent woman isnt smart  
> \>"hey its ok pete" - ella sees pete cringing like a puckered butt hole  
> \>"i know why you did it, you have nothing to be ashamed of"  
> \>pete lightens up like someone stuck a needle full of adrenaline into his chest  
> \>meanwhile, im lost in ella's eyes... studying her beautiful face as she talks   
> \>"so, im going to give you your chance! go ahead, ask"  
> \>"a-a-a-ask what?" - pete shits the bed  
> \>ella tilts her head and gives him a "really?" face  
> \>pete comes around again  
> \>gains his composure like a champ for the first time during the conversation  
> \>"well.. do you want to grab a cup of coffee with me after school?"  
> \>ella smiles at him and playfully nods with her eyes closed  
> \>"i would love that pete" - and she chuckles  
> \>and i sit there like a faggot thinking of asking "can i come too?"  
> \>ella is beyond words to me  
> \>i feel stupid and powerless near her  
> \>"thank you..." - pete barely makes any sense  
> \>i cant imagine being in his place right now  
> \>getting the greenlight from ella after believing that he fucked up so badly  
> \>ella laughs playfully and changes the subject  
> \>so we sat there and talked about our lives and how we knew each other for an hour  
> \>and i was able to get to know ella  
> \>even if it was for a little bit  
> \>but it was an amazing experience  

> \>couple of weeks later  
> \>pete and ella were a couple  
> \>ive never seen pete so happy   
> \>he was over the clouds, all the time  
> \>the guy was out of his mind  
> \>counting seconds for their next date everytime he kissed ella goodbye  
> \>and i was happy for my bro  
> \>but at the same time  
> \>i couldnt help but feel uneasy everytime i saw ella  
> \>ella was still the most amazing woman i have ever seen in my life  
> \>nothing came remotely close to matching her beauty  
> \>not to mention her wits  
> \>and speaking to her was more fun than i could ever have, doing anything  
> \>and i was trying extremely hard not to fall for her  
> \>i owed it to my bro and to myself  
> \>fortunately, ella came to my help  
> \>she introduced her fried nicole to me  
> \>nicole was the girl in pete's fashion class, the girl ella was talking about  
> \>nicole was an incredibly beautiful girl  
> \>she was this amazing redhead  
> \>5'6", big soft titties, nice curvy body  
> \>pale blue eyes, cute little freckles on her face  
> \>you would think that a beautiful girl like ella wouldnt be bffs with another beauty like nicole  
> \>9 out of 10 times, you would be right  
> \>but ella had no competition  
> \>she was beyond competition  
> \>ella could have been friends with the biggest bimbo there ever was  
> \>or she could have been hanging out with a fucking swedish bikini team  
> \>she could have been sleepwalking in her pjs on a victorias secret catwalk at a new years show for all i care  
> \>no matter the situation, ella was always the one you looked at first  
> \>but yeah... nicole was a bombshell too  
> \>and she was something else entirely...  

> \>4 of us started hanging out together  
> \>started going to the parties  
> \>hanging out after school  
> \>going to the movies  
> \>and slowly, nicole and i got very close  
> \>she had an amazing sense of humor  
> \>knew a lot about subcultures and shit  
> \>finally, after a night out together  
> \>pete and ella decided to go to ella's room by themselves  
> \>turns out ella's roommate was back at home for a family emergency or something like that  
> \>and nicole and i kissed  
> \>soon after, we officialy became a couple  
> \>after what felt like an eternity, i wasnt interested in ella that much  
> \>it felt good, not feeling like cheating on my bro  
> \>nicole was amazing in bed  
> \>in all things related to sex, she was a dream come true  
> \>the fantazies she was into were mind boggling  
> \>the things she wore to turn me on  
> \>stockings, garterbelts, schoolgirl outfits  
> \>surprising me with wake up bjs after a long night of sex  
> \>OHLAWD  
> \>some nights i would think, how the fuck am i supposed to regain my sexual appetite after this  
> \>a couple hours later, there she was again  
> \>wearing something ridiculously sexy  
> \>doing things you could lose your mind for  
> \>the places we fucked   
> \>and the positions we tried were pure pornographic shit  
> \>it felt like half of my daily diet was being used for producing semen  
> \>she wouldnt use condoms  
> \>NOSIR  
> \>"wheres the fun in that?" - she asked me the first time we were about to have sex  
> \>she sucked my dick like a vacuum and swallowed everything  
> \>smiling like a sassy high school girl  
> \>always wanting more and more  

> \>good thing i was fit and young  
> \>you cant do some of the things she asked for when youre 29  
> \>i would eat her out until i couldnt feel my tongue  
> \>the girl was a queen of multiple orgasms  
> \>there was no stopping until she said enough  
> \>her sexual needs were so immense, i had a hard time satisfying her...  
> \>i was scared shitless if there would come a time when im simply not enough  
> \>but...  
> \>she was loyal and honest as fuck  
> \>never even flirted with the other guys, let alone cheat on me  
> \>i was really skeptical at first  
> \>its a complete opposite of what you would expect  
> \>i somehow raised the issue with a delicate yet curious manner  
> \>i was treading lightly  
> \>didnt want to offend her  
> \>"youre mine anon, and im yours" - she told me  
> \>"nothing will change that until such a time comes that we both decide otherwise" - she would furiously declare  
> \>if there ever was a woman made out of wife material  
> \>nicole was the ultimate prototype  
> \>her understanding of a relationship was beyond belief  
> \>and her connection to me was unbreakable  
> \>she was so incorruptible  
> \>she would straight up hit the guys trying to chat her up in their faces  
> \>"you come near me again and i swear to god i will use my entire boyfriend like a retractable baton and fuck you in the ass with him"  
> \>thats an actual fucking quote i heard her shout at some poor kid  
> \>HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT.  
> \>and there i was, standing like a beta fag who has just won the lottery  
> \>my diamond hard dick pulsating to her commanding voice  
> \>then she kisses me like there is no tomorrow  
> \>finds an empty room in a house full of partying people  
> \>hangs my sock on the door knob  
> \>and fucks my brains out  
> \>yeah... that was nicole in a nutshell  

> \>so i have never imagined there would be trouble at the paradise  
> \>but come summer time, something else happened  
> \>my dad asked one of his old friends in LA for an internship position on my behalf  
> \>his friend accepted me to his firm  
> \>and while everyone was having a great time  
> \>i was supposed to work at the accounting department of this design office in LA  
> \>this meant that i wasnt going to spend my summer satisfying nicole  
> \>or doing anything fun for that matter  
> \>before she went to the airport  
> \>nicole kissed me as if we werent going to see each other again, like ever  
> \>"you don't forget who you belong to mister..." - she told me with tearful eyes  
> \>"i wont nicole, i promise"  
> \>man... the love and care this girl had shown me was something else  
> \>even tho i told her numerous times that i loved her - and i meant it  
> \>i had this feeling that my love for her didnt even come close to what she felt towards me  
> \>"you take care of yourself, you hear?" - and she left, hesitantly walking backwards to her bus to the airport  
> \>pete had already gone home previous weekend  
> \>so i was all by myself, walking around in this college ghost town  
> \>on my way back to the dorm  
> \>wanting to pack my stuff asap and get ready for my flight to LA  
> \>there she was, walking towards me  
> \>ella...  
> \>"hey! sup anon?" - she greeted me with a warm smile  
> \>"hey ella... i just sent off nicole"  
> \>"awww.. you guuuyyss... she cried right?" - with a snappy laugh - "i know she cried!"  
> \>"haha, well you know her, right?"  
> \>"she loves you anon, thats why" - ella reached out and stroked my arm, showing the she cared  
> \>for the first time in quite a while, i suddenly felt a jolt, a rush  
> \>it was like the time when i first saw her upclose  
> \>as her cold hands brushed my skin, my pupils dilated  
> \>like the first sip of a morning coffee  
> \>a surge of a small dose of adrenaline hit my body  

> \>i quickly broke out of her spell  
> \>i had to  
> \>"so.. where are you off to ella?"

> \>WUT  
> \>"ummm... we might be on the same flight.." - that was the most sexually neutral thing i could think of at that time  
> \>"you serious? what are you doing in LA?" - ella asked with a delighted curiosity, her big green eyes glimmering with excitement  
> \>"i have this job my dad arranged for me.. im not exactly going there for a vacation" - i pout

> \>before i could say anything  
> \>"oh! look at the time, i gotta go now, but hey, see you in LA, if not earlier!" - she winked at me

now i know there must be a lot of you out there, calling me a beta fag
but if bros before hoes doesnt apply here, then where else?

> \>the only thing i was able to do was to raise my head out of her hair

> \>"i love her man, i fucking love her" - the time he told me at a party, watching ella from the other side of the room  
> \>with an admiration and love i havent seen before on any mans face  
> \>then i remember nicole again  
> \>and the discernment and the loyalty she has displayed time and again in the face of temptation  
> \>i felt like shit  
> \>concentrated, wc clogging brick of a shit  

> \>an excruciating hour later she woke up  
> \>she blinked her eyes rapidly as she tried to sober up  
> \>and yawned and stretched  
> \>i was losing my mind to the sight of her delicate body

> \>i was trying to force myself to look away  
> \>not notice her  
> \>but i couldnt  
> \>she looked at me with her sleepy green eyes  
> \>"oh, sorry anon... i get very untidy in my sleep" - she chuckled

> \>shortly after we parted ways, i called nicole and talked to her for an hour  
> \>trying to remind myself of who i am  
> \>and texted pete, telling him about how ella and i were on the same flight to LA  
> \>i hated myself for feeling that an explanation was necessary  
> \>"hey pete, dont worry buddy, my dick wasnt fully erect the whole time she was sleeping on my shoulder" - sorta thing  
> \>"it got hard only when she started stretching her muscles... its aaaiight.."

> \>reddish spots are formed over her soft cheeks

> \>and then i see them...  
> \>i dont think ive ever seen such breasts before  
> \>not with my own eyes  
> \>not in pictures, not in real life  
> \>slightly bigger than plump greyfruits

> \>they stand at attention  
> \>amused by the incompetence of frail gravity  
> \>her small nipples, mildly protruding out of her bikini top  
> \>like searchlights, pointing way up into the sky  
> \>my eyes hover over that sight for a few seconds  
> \>and admire her chest like they have seen the most beautiful work of art ever created  
> \>then i look down  
> \>see her belly  
> \>she has a set of lightly defined muscles surrounding her tummy  
> \>her waist is lean  
> \>and forms a very elegant and gentle hourglass shape  
> \>as they connect to her curvy yet tight hips  
> \>another piece of black cloth covers the magnificent V shape  
> \>the sight of a barely concealed bulge on the cloth stops my heart for a second  
> \>it is an unbelievable awareness, knowing whats behind that cloth  
> \>there is a small opening beneath her crotch  
> \>and i can see the sandy beach in the background from between her legs  
> \>as the lengthy muscles on her thighs expand and contract  
> \>and shiver and vibrate to the warm breeze of cali  
> \>her small knees play around  
> \>and her lower legs keep to the pace  
> \>as the tanned muscles around her tibias enjoy the sunlight  
> \>her feet dig shallow spots in the sand  
> \>tip of her toes curl and point   
> \>her heels ascend out of the sand and dance in the air  
> \>ella. words are empty...

> \>"i... im.. in a minute, yeah..."  
> \>i wasnt about to display the biggest tent of my life in front of everyone   
> \>she voices a snappy laugh and starts backstroking away from the beach  
> \>i sit there and start reciting the multiplication table  
> \>as if i was with nicole in bed, trying to delay the inevitable  
> \>moments later i join her  
> \>"um... sorry about before" - i apologize sheepishly  
> \>"haha! dont worry about it, you should have seen pete's face when he first saw me in my underwear"

> \>basically like everything else about her, ella was not exactly your usual sorority girl  
> \>she was in her own alpha-omega-fuckyou club

> \>you would think there is a physical limit to how close you can get to someone

> \>that night, i dont remember for how many hours  
> \>we were inseperable  
> \>we didnt say a word the entire time

> \>she was the one person dearest to me, above everyone else  
> \>she was my missing piece  
> \>after a long long time has past, i remember finally whispering

> \>it was almost dawn when i woke up  
> \>ella woke up with me  
> \>"i have to tell you something..." - i told her  
> \>she looked at me, scared and upset  
> \>"i have to go to hong kong for 2 months... today... i wont be able to spend the rest of summer with you..."

> \>i couldnt have been happier  
> \>hong kong seemed like a punishment after everything that has happened  
> \>but i knew ella would wait for me  
> \>ella sent me away  
> \>convinced me that if we spent even more time  
> \>or if she would come to LAX to see me off, the distance and time would be even harder to bear  
> \>i agreed  
> \>as i was dragging my feet to leave her, i kissed her so much, she had to physically push me away  
> \>giggling with a sleepy face  
> \>"go now! go or you will miss your flight!"
